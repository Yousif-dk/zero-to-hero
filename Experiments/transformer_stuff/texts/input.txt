[25/04/2025, 08.21.45] Ems : Dinner idea for next time, we get popcorn and just sit on the roof to look at all the weird shit going on
[25/04/2025, 08.21.59] Ems : Also I'm getting worried for your safety
[25/04/2025, 08.22.43] Yousif Zaid: It’s funny he felt the need to specify that this naked screaming man at 5 am was also, as a matter of fact, “weird”
[25/04/2025, 08.23.43] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
This guy mustn't have been living there for long
[25/04/2025, 08.24.10] Ems : If he'd have heard about the burglary he would've been fine with it
[25/04/2025, 08.24.14] Yousif Zaid: Might have been a dramatic couple break up
[25/04/2025, 08.24.57] Ems : I love that you guys have a group chat just to tell the drama
[25/04/2025, 08.25.10] Yousif Zaid: Also advertise scams
[25/04/2025, 08.25.36] Yousif Zaid: I read in bed at night with my window open right next to the path and I keep hearing people full speed running it’s very distracting
[25/04/2025, 08.26.23] Ems : Not very nice of them to distract you from the brothers karamazov
[25/04/2025, 08.26.35] Yousif Zaid: Who sprints at 1 am?
[25/04/2025, 08.26.40] Ems : Kind of rude tbh
[25/04/2025, 08.26.41] Yousif Zaid: Is my question
[25/04/2025, 08.27.08] Ems : The Danes seem to be very into running for some reason
[25/04/2025, 08.27.25] Ems : Especially when drunk
[25/04/2025, 08.27.48] Yousif Zaid: To me a sprint makes me feel like I’m being hunted
[25/04/2025, 08.28.22] Ems : Yeah like I'm not in the hunger games I don't need to run
[25/04/2025, 08.28.53] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes I jog, last time I sprinted was this December
[25/04/2025, 08.29.56] Ems : I feel like I enjoy sprinting now more, I used to jog now it feels like unnecessary torture
[25/04/2025, 08.30.41] Yousif Zaid: Boxing is all the cardio I need. I never thought lightly punching Dimitri in the stomach for 3 minutes straight could be such torture
[25/04/2025, 08.36.52] Ems : Yeah I can imagine, what if you just bring someone really annoying though?
[25/04/2025, 08.37.53] Yousif Zaid: One time a really old fat middle aged dude hit me while I was trying to touch gloves while we sparred so I beat him up
[25/04/2025, 08.38.04] Yousif Zaid: It was really pathetic he wore thick glasses

[25/05/2025, 21.17.32] Yousif Zaid: I lent it to you I think
[25/05/2025, 21.17.39] Yousif Zaid: What did you walk out of my house with
[25/05/2025, 21.17.49] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[25/05/2025, 21.18.16] Ems : image omitted
[25/05/2025, 21.18.47] Yousif Zaid: You should’ve also taken Johnny got his gu.
[25/05/2025, 21.18.51] Ems : I love this
[25/05/2025, 21.19.09] Ems : Ok I'll ask you to lend it soon
[25/05/2025, 21.19.25] Yousif Zaid: The only book here that might take long to read is blood meridian
[25/05/2025, 21.19.37] Yousif Zaid: Slaughterhouse five is a weekend read and the old man is an evening
[25/05/2025, 21.23.02] Yousif Zaid: It’s so fucking good though I’m telling you
[25/05/2025, 21.23.21] Yousif Zaid: Shits biblical
[25/05/2025, 21.23.30] Ems : Ok I trust you but the decapitated baby is kind of holding me back
[25/05/2025, 21.23.42] Yousif Zaid: Not exactly decapitated
[25/05/2025, 21.23.46] Ems : But don't worry I'll read it with no prejudice
[25/05/2025, 21.23.48] Ems : ...
[25/05/2025, 21.24.09] Yousif Zaid: Well the author wanted to write some kind of anti western
[25/05/2025, 21.24.23] Yousif Zaid: Like “here is the violence it took to build America, it wasn’t pretty and we weren’t heroes”
[25/05/2025, 21.24.45] Yousif Zaid: He was tired of all the heroic handsome cowboys defeating bad guys
[25/05/2025, 21.25.18] Ems : It sounds like a really good book
[25/05/2025, 21.25.20] Ems : Honestly
[25/05/2025, 21.25.32] Ems : I can take some graphic violence for good content
[25/05/2025, 21.25.39] Yousif Zaid: Also the protagonist is just called “the kid” which I find really cool
[25/05/2025, 21.27.03] Ems : Should I start with the old man and the sea first?
[25/05/2025, 21.27.20] Yousif Zaid: It’ll take you one day to read and it’s very satisfying I think
[25/05/2025, 21.27.31] Yousif Zaid: I love old man Santiago
[25/05/2025, 21.33.30] Ems : Same
[25/05/2025, 21.34.00] Yousif Zaid: I promise I’ll read 50 pages of the brothers tonight
[25/05/2025, 21.35.09] Ems : Very ambitious considering the lack of sleep
[25/05/2025, 21.35.41] Ems : You can do it
[25/05/2025, 21.35.48] Ems : I'm also reading tight now
[25/05/2025, 21.35.51] Ems : Right
[25/05/2025, 21.36.29] Yousif Zaid: I’m at the gym right now I gotta hop in this sauna with naked dudes
[25/05/2025, 21.36.33] Yousif Zaid: Wish me luck
[25/05/2025, 21.42.58] Ems : Good luck
[25/05/2025, 21.43.18] Ems : It's always the ones you don't want to see naked
[25/05/2025, 22.07.32] Yousif Zaid: I think I was that guy today
[25/05/2025, 22.25.13] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
[25/05/2025, 22.25.17] Ems : No way
[25/05/2025, 22.25.25] Ems : It was probably full of naked old men
[25/05/2025, 22.25.27] Yousif Zaid: How am I the only guy that showers naked
[25/05/2025, 22.25.35] Yousif Zaid: I feel like it’s not that weird
[25/05/2025, 22.25.44] Yousif Zaid: Everyone else was in their underwear showering
[25/05/2025, 22.26.30] Ems : It's not at least in the girls' changing room
[25/05/2025, 22.26.42] Ems : Maybe you really were that guy then
[25/05/2025, 22.26.52] Yousif Zaid: I literally was
[25/05/2025, 22.26.57] Yousif Zaid: Ppl was looking at me man
[25/05/2025, 22.27.23] Ems : You were definitely that guy
[25/05/2025, 22.27.36] Ems : I don't get it though
[25/05/2025, 22.27.45] Ems : Who showers in their underwear
[25/05/2025, 22.27.52] Yousif Zaid: Arabs have a problem with showering naked
[25/05/2025, 22.28.02] Yousif Zaid: And the area my gym is in is mostly Arabs

[26/05/2025, 12.43.00] Ems : Cool
[26/05/2025, 12.43.04] Yousif Zaid: Completely absurd that I’m allowed to have this job
[26/05/2025, 12.43.21] Ems : You look the part though
[26/05/2025, 12.44.02] Yousif Zaid: I’m enjoying a nice lay down in the grass
[26/05/2025, 12.46.57] Ems : Getting some of those worms on you
[26/05/2025, 12.47.03] Yousif Zaid: Oh yeah

[26/05/2025, 13.37.25] Ems : I remember
[26/05/2025, 13.37.34] Yousif Zaid: This makes me want to go less
[26/05/2025, 13.37.48] Yousif Zaid: What if our favourite guy is also there
[26/05/2025, 13.38.38] Ems : Then it's double the fun
[26/05/2025, 13.38.46] Ems : Imagine seeing that guy while drunk
[26/05/2025, 13.38.53] Yousif Zaid: He might hit his basketball move on the dance floor
[26/05/2025, 13.39.00] Yousif Zaid: [26/05/2025, 13.39.08] Ems : I would die
[26/05/2025, 13.39.12] Ems : I'm not joking

[26/05/2025, 14.45.22] Yousif Zaid: No I hate the way they do computer shit
[26/05/2025, 14.45.31] Yousif Zaid: They are making my life really hard
[26/05/2025, 14.45.59] Ems : Do they ask you to code simple stuff that you find boring?
[26/05/2025, 14.46.21] Yousif Zaid: They are asking me to code really complex shit to solve simple problems
[26/05/2025, 14.46.41] Yousif Zaid: And the code has to be complex because the data is dogshit
[26/05/2025, 14.46.57] Yousif Zaid: It’s like asking me to build a bird house with grains of sand instead of those popsicle sticks
[26/05/2025, 14.49.36] Ems : That is the most far fetched comparison I have ever heard
[26/05/2025, 14.49.48] Ems : It works though
[26/05/2025, 14.50.03] Yousif Zaid: You ever make one of those bird houses out of popsicle sticks
[26/05/2025, 14.50.07] Yousif Zaid: Fun as hell
[26/05/2025, 14.50.15] Ems : YES

[26/05/2025, 15.02.40] Ems : If it's a good flavour I'd say realistically 7 or 8

[26/05/2025, 15.10.13] Yousif Zaid: This popsicle house will suck
[26/05/2025, 15.16.32] Ems : It will
[26/05/2025, 15.16.45] Ems : Maybe not a bird house but an ants nest
[26/05/2025, 15.16.50] Ems : So we don't need too many

[04/06/2025, 15.03.16] Yousif Zaid: Like a Guinness stairmaster
[04/06/2025, 15.03.33] Yousif Zaid: The bench press would have to be some kind of lager
[04/06/2025, 15.03.53] Ems : Or like carlsberg or grøn walking thingy
[04/06/2025, 15.04.06] Yousif Zaid: This is a business idea
[04/06/2025, 15.18.45] Ems : For sure
[04/06/2025, 15.18.54] Yousif Zaid: I have no aim in life

[04/06/2025, 15.26.07] Ems : There's better desserts but thinking of you making macaroons is really funny
[04/06/2025, 15.26.24] Ems : Like wearing a chef hat
[04/06/2025, 15.26.24] Yousif Zaid: I have a precise hand.

[04/06/2025, 15.28.39] Yousif Zaid: It’s still surreal to me that we’re actually done with the exams
[04/06/2025, 15.29.56] Ems : I know I was kind of lost when I got home today
[04/06/2025, 15.31.04] Yousif Zaid: I’m doing random shit like picking my mom up from work
[04/06/2025, 15.34.58] Ems : That's nice though

[04/06/2025, 21.18.07] Yousif Zaid: I just remembered
[04/06/2025, 21.18.43] Yousif Zaid: If verdant is really 55 kg and can drink an entire bottle of vodka, he’d be 1.8% vodka by weight
[04/06/2025, 21.44.17] Ems : Yeah but he wouldn't feel the effects
[04/06/2025, 21.44.21] Ems : He's that tough
[04/06/2025, 21.44.38] Yousif Zaid: Picking him up was fun you should try it
[04/06/2025, 21.45.42] Ems : Idk I have a feeling that would create a hole in the space time continuum or something
[04/06/2025, 21.45.47] Ems : Can't happen
[04/06/2025, 21.46.32] Ems : But when you picked him up how much do you think he weighed?
[04/06/2025, 21.55.26] Yousif Zaid: It would be an awe striking sight
[04/06/2025, 21.56.04] Yousif Zaid: Honestly he might have been telling the truth about his weight
[04/06/2025, 21.56.10] Yousif Zaid: It was like a pack of Kleenex
[04/06/2025, 22.26.26] Ems : Damn

[07/06/2025, 12.06.01] Ems : Shut up
[07/06/2025, 12.06.20] Yousif Zaid: I’m being serious if I came up with a joke like that I’d be proud of myself
[07/06/2025, 12.06.53] Ems : You'll have to re-enact
[07/06/2025, 12.06.59] Yousif Zaid: Okay

[07/06/2025, 12.14.03] Ems : You definitely said something to start that
[07/06/2025, 12.17.58] Yousif Zaid: “I’m fried”
“Im fucked”
“I’m sautéed”
[07/06/2025, 12.18.12] Yousif Zaid: It’s to express how drunk I am, not an emotional state
[07/06/2025, 12.18.20] Yousif Zaid: Yes for sure
[07/06/2025, 12.25.45] Yousif Zaid: I can be fucked and happy

[07/06/2025, 15.26.03] Yousif Zaid: I mean obviously we’re not gonna fucking tell him to sit in his room while we watch twilight in the living room but I was picturing a big screen or projector we could use in one of the dtu buildings
[07/06/2025, 15.27.24] Ems : Ok i don't mind
[07/06/2025, 15.28.10] Yousif Zaid: But we can obviously invite Claudio if you want that’s not what I was being pissy about, I just meant the location

[12/06/2025, 17.45.27] Yousif Zaid: It crossed my mind and I got curious
[12/06/2025, 17.46.22] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been told I’m different when I speak Danish

[14/06/2025, 10.33.12] Yousif Zaid: Louis joined us which is very fun, he’s living with me at my parents house this weekend
[14/06/2025, 10.34.19] Yousif Zaid: His own parents rented out their apartment so we adopted him for a couple of days. Louis gets along with our friend group very well which makes me super happy. Gabrielle showed up and literally did not say 1 word or comment for 4 hours and creeped even Louis out; he told me who is that guy why is he here
[14/06/2025, 10.37.01] Yousif Zaid: Tell me about England

[14/06/2025, 11.32.22] Yousif Zaid: That is so beautiful. Idk there’s something there. Gray weather looks better in England than it does in Denmark

[14/06/2025, 13.37.07] Ems : It's really lovely

[14/06/2025, 13.38.23] Yousif Zaid: It’s pretty good! I wouldn’t say as good as the loaf you made
[14/06/2025, 13.38.52] Yousif Zaid: So you travelled from rainy Denmark to go to rainy England and then the sun began shining here as soon as you left. That’s unlucky
[14/06/2025, 14.13.20] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[14/06/2025, 16.50.45] Ems : And cider
[14/06/2025, 16.51.01] Yousif Zaid: I want photos when it’s all done

[16/06/2025, 19.46.23] Ems : I was considering once I got home, but I think I'll be too late
[16/06/2025, 19.46.49] Yousif Zaid: I was there earlier in the day, it didn’t seem so fantastic
[16/06/2025, 19.49.05] Yousif Zaid: You at the airport or something?
[16/06/2025, 19.58.26] Ems : Good to hear

[16/06/2025, 20.02.01] Yousif Zaid: Well the weather is nice now at least. How was it?
[16/06/2025, 20.03.55] Ems : I think it might be dark by the time I get there, maybe I see the sunset
[16/06/2025, 20.04.00] Ems : It was so so nice
[16/06/2025, 20.04.14] Ems : The wedding was fun and being in England is always great
[16/06/2025, 20.04.19] Yousif Zaid: Want a ride or something?

[16/06/2025, 20.07.18] Ems : There was a poll I believe
[16/06/2025, 20.08.13] Yousif Zaid: That would be tommorow
[16/06/2025, 20.08.42] Ems : That's literally what I said
[16/06/2025, 20.09.12] Yousif Zaid: Like I said I was just napping. Eyelids still glued together
[16/06/2025, 20.10.06] Ems : Alright go back to sleep, I think that's wise

[16/06/2025, 20.12.56] Yousif Zaid: Me and Louis went to Laura’s bday party. I dressed as our English teacher from high school and Louis dressed as the kid. That’s the protagonist from blood meridian, the cowboy book I lent you

[17/06/2025, 23.02.06] Yousif Zaid: Keeping the group balance
[17/06/2025, 23.02.59] Ems : The stuff about the group balance is really telling me not to join
[17/06/2025, 23.03.26] Ems : But sailing sounds good so I'll decide tomorrow
[17/06/2025, 23.03.31] Yousif Zaid: When I die and go to heaven my first question to god will be “what does he mean by group balance”

[17/06/2025, 23.04.23] Yousif Zaid: I’ve never been hanging out with just the guys and thought to myself “you know I really wish a woman was here”. Like it doesn’t matter
[17/06/2025, 23.04.38] Ems : Ikr
[17/06/2025, 23.04.42] Ems : Literally
[17/06/2025, 23.04.48] Ems : I don't know
[17/06/2025, 23.05.04] Yousif Zaid: Like if they’re there. Fine? The more the merrier but it’s not like we can’t have fun without them
[17/06/2025, 23.05.28] Ems : It's the group balance Yousif come on
[17/06/2025, 23.06.05] Yousif Zaid: Yeah. Every time I’m hanging out with Louis I just “man I wish marta was here”

[17/06/2025, 23.09.12] Ems : So bad
[17/06/2025, 23.09.44] Yousif Zaid: He’s an old man. I took him on a really long walk and at some point he refused to keep going. Almost to say “fuck you take me home”
[17/06/2025, 23.10.15] Ems : Oh bless him
[17/06/2025, 23.10.20] Ems : So cute
[17/06/2025, 23.10.34] Ems : That's too British I'm sorry
[17/06/2025, 23.10.37] Yousif Zaid: He’s a complete dumbass. Such a dumb creature
[17/06/2025, 23.10.52] Yousif Zaid: I like the British side more than the Italian it’s fine
[17/06/2025, 23.11.03] Yousif Zaid: I get enough of the Italian at home
[17/06/2025, 23.11.35] Ems : Yeah you get a lot of pasta talk already
[17/06/2025, 23.11.44] Ems : I want to meet him
[17/06/2025, 23.11.45] Yousif Zaid: “See the thing is…”
[17/06/2025, 23.11.48] Ems : Please
[17/06/2025, 23.11.52] Ems : HAHAHHAHA

[18/06/2025, 13.32.32] Yousif Zaid: You have quite a few options to do that
[18/06/2025, 13.33.02] Ems : Even the facial expression
[18/06/2025, 13.33.08] Ems : I don't know
[18/06/2025, 13.33.19] Yousif Zaid: The pot belly and moustache

[18/06/2025, 13.34.18] Ems : Yeahhh
[18/06/2025, 13.34.23] Ems : True that
[18/06/2025, 13.34.45] Yousif Zaid: You still on the fence about the sailing thing?
[18/06/2025, 14.13.17] Ems : Honestly I'm leaning more towards yes
[18/06/2025, 14.13.27] Ems : But yeah option is still open
[18/06/2025, 14.13.36] Yousif Zaid: I’m straight up falling asleep at my desk

[18/06/2025, 14.14.13] Ems : Get some caffeine in you
[18/06/2025, 14.14.23] Yousif Zaid: I’ll shit myself infront of my coworkers
[18/06/2025, 14.14.33] Ems : Combination of beer and experiment is not great
[18/06/2025, 14.14.39] Ems : They can take it
[18/06/2025, 14.14.49] Yousif Zaid: Heroic statement
[18/06/2025, 14.15.15] Ems : Hahahahhahahah
[18/06/2025, 14.15.46] Ems : You really have a thing about shitting yourself
[18/06/2025, 14.16.59] Yousif Zaid: Don’t say it like that
[18/06/2025, 14.19.13] Ems : It just seems like a big fear of yours

[18/06/2025, 22.06.26] Ems : That actually looks quite fun
[18/06/2025, 22.06.30] Ems : How was it?
[18/06/2025, 22.06.39] Yousif Zaid: Well it was really hard for me
[18/06/2025, 22.06.46] Yousif Zaid: Also I found out runners are not my crowd
[18/06/2025, 22.06.57] Yousif Zaid: But I had a lot of fun with Ines and jaap
[18/06/2025, 22.07.07] Yousif Zaid: It’s like running is their whole life
[18/06/2025, 22.08.15] Yousif Zaid: I bumped into this guy and he grabbed his arm like I shot him and started whining
[18/06/2025, 22.17.16] Ems : They take themselves way too seriously
[18/06/2025, 22.17.28] Ems : The beer was a good reward though
[18/06/2025, 22.18.37] Yousif Zaid: Oh yeah. I’m walking home and I will get good sleep

[18/06/2025, 22.20.20] Yousif Zaid: It was 2 laps around fælledparken
[18/06/2025, 22.20.26] Yousif Zaid: It was like a mass psychosis of sorts
[18/06/2025, 22.20.40] Yousif Zaid: The music was bad, and everyone kept filming themselves as if they were Usain Bolt
[18/06/2025, 22.20.57] Ems : I can just see it
[18/06/2025, 22.21.20] Yousif Zaid: Like imagine an old person listening to daft punk and then misunderstanding why it’s good
[18/06/2025, 22.21.26] Yousif Zaid: That’s the only way I can describe their music
[18/06/2025, 22.23.19] Ems : Do you remember any songs?
[18/06/2025, 22.23.48] Yousif Zaid: Literally none it was all like generic “club music” that you hear in movies that don’t want to pay for actual songs
[18/06/2025, 22.26.35] Ems : Nice
[18/06/2025, 22.26.45] Ems : And running 5 k with tha

[18/06/2025, 22.31.47] Ems : They are such a good time
[18/06/2025, 22.31.57] Yousif Zaid: Speaking German and shit
[18/06/2025, 22.32.13] Yousif Zaid: The real run was 6K but I skipped half a lap cuz I was dying and only did 4.5k
[18/06/2025, 22.49.05] Ems : That's really good
[20/06/2025, 09.02.18] Yousif Zaid: We have a lecture right? What building?
[20/06/2025, 09.05.14] Ems : The one we had computer programming in

[22/06/2025, 14.43.16] Yousif Zaid: i wish i could have joined but i kind of felt like i was dying the entire day
[22/06/2025, 14.43.21] Ems : I left at around 8 though and they stayed to eat out
[22/06/2025, 14.43.30] Ems : Yeah I get it
[22/06/2025, 14.43.49] Yousif Zaid: the DB2 work is a drag. i think i'll finish up and go for a joyride later, the weather is nice
[22/06/2025, 14.44.28] Ems : Fair enough
[22/06/2025, 14.44.38] Ems : I still need to read all the reports
[22/06/2025, 14.44.41] Ems : God
[22/06/2025, 14.44.43] Yousif Zaid: all of them?
[22/06/2025, 14.44.47] Ems : You just reminded me
[22/06/2025, 14.44.55] Yousif Zaid: the way our group is doing it is that we just each pick one and answer the questions for it
[22/06/2025, 14.45.08] Ems : Nono I meant the research for the poster
[22/06/2025, 14.45.21] Yousif Zaid: yeah that's what i'm talking about too?
[22/06/2025, 14.46.40] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[22/06/2025, 14.54.12] Yousif Zaid: its 13 pages long and really difficult to understand
[22/06/2025, 14.54.29] Yousif Zaid: honestly i think it's pointless to try read all 3 of them
[22/06/2025, 14.54.43] Ems : Ok I'll tell them to divide
[22/06/2025, 14.54.46] Ems : That's smart

[22/06/2025, 14.56.09] Yousif Zaid: walking?
[22/06/2025, 14.56.31] Ems : I thought you meant drive then walk
[22/06/2025, 14.56.33] Ems : Nvm
[22/06/2025, 14.56.57] Yousif Zaid: we could probably drive to that one castle actually, its a very nice walk
[22/06/2025, 14.57.16] Ems : Ok let's do that
[22/06/2025, 14.57.23] Yousif Zaid: its like a mini-versailles
[22/06/2025, 14.57.29] Yousif Zaid: but much more pathetic because it's danish
[22/06/2025, 14.57.39] Ems : Hahahahahahha

[22/06/2025, 15.12.10] Yousif Zaid: Okay I realise “a couple” means 2 but I was hoping for 5:30 or something like that
[22/06/2025, 15.38.41] Ems : Okk
[22/06/2025, 17.29.52] Yousif Zaid: Will be there in 15

[22/06/2025, 23.07.25] Ems : Yeah you're balance was impressive
[22/06/2025, 23.07.37] Ems : You would've been swimming with the ducks

[22/06/2025, 23.17.16] Ems : Doesn't sound too bad
[22/06/2025, 23.17.45] Ems : Listening to her singing rehab would be funny

[23/06/2025, 14.52.56] Yousif Zaid: I found a bag containing vials of untreated raw sewage
[23/06/2025, 14.53.03] Yousif Zaid: This shit is shit

[23/06/2025, 14.53.12] Ems : It is indeed shit
[23/06/2025, 14.53.30] Ems : I know why they have them but it still feels weird
[23/06/2025, 14.53.55] Yousif Zaid: The women’s urine somehow feels stranger
[23/06/2025, 15.05.27] Ems : I think it's because it's very specific
[23/06/2025, 15.05.28] Ems : Like
[23/06/2025, 15.05.33] Ems : Why women's
[23/06/2025, 15.17.45] Yousif Zaid: Right?? “Human urine samples” sounds so normal
[23/06/2025, 15.18.13] Yousif Zaid: I dig up a plastic bag filled with 32 vials labelled “woman’s urine”
[23/06/2025, 15.18.17] Yousif Zaid: Doesn’t even say female
[23/06/2025, 15.52.43] Ems : You're right that would have made it better
[23/06/2025, 15.52.45] Ems : Wait
[23/06/2025, 15.52.54] Ems : Did it say woman singular
[23/06/2025, 15.57.40] Yousif Zaid: It said and I quote
[23/06/2025, 15.57.44] Yousif Zaid: “Woman’s urine”
[23/06/2025, 16.47.35] Ems : Uuf
[23/06/2025, 16.47.41] Ems : That's not good

[23/06/2025, 21.33.48] Ems : Oh I can't wait to try them
[23/06/2025, 21.34.00] Ems : How did you get them at the reception?
[23/06/2025, 21.34.16] Yousif Zaid: I walked out and strolled down the street to a store
[23/06/2025, 21.34.24] Yousif Zaid: Bought 2 snus and a lighter and cigs for 140 dkk

[24/06/2025, 15.03.47] Yousif Zaid: Why?
[24/06/2025, 15.03.48] Ems : Apparently the boat fit 8 ppl
[24/06/2025, 15.03.53] Ems : Boats*
[24/06/2025, 15.04.05] Yousif Zaid: Just pick your favourite people lol

[24/06/2025, 15.05.18] Ems : I just think I really can't do it
[24/06/2025, 15.11.32] Ems : Like I only needed to leave out one person between the ones that answered
[24/06/2025, 15.11.46] Ems : I don't want the responsibility
[24/06/2025, 15.14.02] Yousif Zaid: They have bigger boats too
[24/06/2025, 15.14.12] Yousif Zaid: But we’re not enough people to fill those

[24/06/2025, 15.19.46] Yousif Zaid: What are the odds that 9/13 of us are willing to go
[24/06/2025, 15.19.55] Yousif Zaid: I’m avoiding the question
[24/06/2025, 15.20.31] Yousif Zaid: If this happens you guys can sacrifice me and I’ll stay home and throw peanuts over the fence at the children at my local kindergarten
[24/06/2025, 15.25.18] Ems : That's obviously not happening
[24/06/2025, 15.25.40] Yousif Zaid: The peanuts have already been purchased. All I’m saying

[24/06/2025, 17.50.41] Yousif Zaid: Boat better kiss me on the forehead for that much money
[24/06/2025, 17.56.02] Ems : The weirdest part about this sentence is the forehead
[24/06/2025, 17.56.13] Ems : You felt the need to specify
[24/06/2025, 17.56.15] Yousif Zaid: Original sentence was a bit vulgar
[24/06/2025, 17.56.21] Ems : I figured
[24/06/2025, 17.56.28] Yousif Zaid: Yeah
[24/06/2025, 17.58.40] Ems : I think I found a solution for the boat though
[24/06/2025, 17.58.48] Yousif Zaid: Piracy?
[24/06/2025, 17.58.47] Ems : I only have to check if it's legit
[24/06/2025, 17.58.55] Ems : Maybe
[24/06/2025, 17.58.59] Yousif Zaid: Well my idea definitely isn’t legit
[24/06/2025, 17.59.01] Ems : Priser – MyBoat.dk https://share.google/HbHVGDteqC3IQwsxa
[24/06/2025, 17.59.18] Ems : We could just jump into one and push the people out
[24/06/2025, 17.59.22] Ems : That's an option
[24/06/2025, 17.59.38] Yousif Zaid: Buying a pirate hat
[24/06/2025, 17.59.56] Ems : YES
[24/06/2025, 18.00.30] Yousif Zaid: Seems good
[24/06/2025, 18.00.38] Yousif Zaid: What kind of fucking website were you looking at before
[24/06/2025, 18.00.48] Ems : Literally goboat
[24/06/2025, 18.00.51] Ems : The main one
[24/06/2025, 18.02.12] Ems : image omitted
[24/06/2025, 18.02.17] Ems : It would be 177 each
[24/06/2025, 18.02.23] Ems : That's very doable
[24/06/2025, 18.02.37] Yousif Zaid: La Mia prenotazione
[24/06/2025, 18.02.48] Yousif Zaid: It’s even got 9 seats
[24/06/2025, 18.02.47] Ems : [24/06/2025, 18.02.53] Ems : Exactly
[24/06/2025, 18.03.02] Ems : I won't have to kick that one person out
[24/06/2025, 18.03.23] Yousif Zaid: I’m personally relieved [24/06/2025, 18.04.30] Ems : The 6000 deposit is fucking scary
[24/06/2025, 18.04.41] Yousif Zaid: The what
[24/06/2025, 18.05.05] Ems : image omitted
[24/06/2025, 18.05.12] Ems : I highlighted it
[24/06/2025, 18.05.22] Yousif Zaid: Uhhhh
[24/06/2025, 18.06.33] Ems : What do you think?
[24/06/2025, 18.07.35] Yousif Zaid: So we each need to put down
[24/06/2025, 18.07.38] Yousif Zaid: 660 dkk
[24/06/2025, 18.08.48] Ems : No if anything one person pays deposit and if it goes to shit everyone pays
[24/06/2025, 18.09.02] Yousif Zaid: I think I’m willing to do it but I doubt 9 people are willing to do it
[24/06/2025, 18.09.19] Yousif Zaid: Might be tough to convince someone to put down 6000 dkk
[24/06/2025, 18.10.07] Ems : If everyone agrees to pay it back I don't see the problem
[24/06/2025, 18.17.04] Yousif Zaid: I guess there isn’t a problem but idk. I’d be scared to put 6 down myself
[24/06/2025, 19.39.44] Ems : image omitted
[24/06/2025, 19.39.55] Ems : It's 7-9 but only 8 ppl
[24/06/2025, 19.43.49] Yousif Zaid: That sounds good!
[24/06/2025, 19.47.02] Yousif Zaid: Do we have 8 ppl that want to come
[24/06/2025, 19.47.23] Yousif Zaid: Me, you, Claudio, marta, Hugo, Ines
[24/06/2025, 19.47.22] Ems : We have 9 I think..
[24/06/2025, 19.47.34] Ems : Jaap soheyl Chris
[24/06/2025, 19.47.43] Yousif Zaid: We could fistfight for the last spot on the boat
[24/06/2025, 19.47.51] Yousif Zaid: Poor Marta. She’ll never know what hit her
[24/06/2025, 19.48.05] Ems : HAHAHAHHAHAHAHJ
[24/06/2025, 19.48.26] Yousif Zaid: Who is the best swimmer?
[24/06/2025, 19.49.30] Ems : Let's see who's the last one to react
[24/06/2025, 19.49.45] Ems : Hunger games
[24/06/2025, 19.49.51] Yousif Zaid: I think I know what you’re hoping for
[24/06/2025, 19.49.58] Ems : Who?
[24/06/2025, 19.50.07] Yousif Zaid: I’m being bashful now
[24/06/2025, 19.50.26] Ems : I'm really not being secretive about it I thought it was obvious
[24/06/2025, 19.51.14] Yousif Zaid: This will be very embarrassing if it’s me
[24/06/2025, 19.52.29] Ems : You got it
[24/06/2025, 19.52.36] Yousif Zaid: Damn we’re not good people
[24/06/2025, 19.52.50] Yousif Zaid: We immediately went for the “who to exclude” instead of just thinking about two boats
[24/06/2025, 19.53.25] Ems : I thought two boats
[24/06/2025, 19.53.31] Ems : It's sad though
[24/06/2025, 19.53.42] Yousif Zaid: It’s expensive not sad
[24/06/2025, 19.53.50] Ems : Both?
[24/06/2025, 19.54.11] Yousif Zaid: Put me on the boat with Soheyl I have to touch him
[24/06/2025, 19.55.08] Ems : I really do not want two boats
[24/06/2025, 19.55.15] Ems : If it comes to it you can
[24/06/2025, 19.55.32] Yousif Zaid: Two big boats that will feel empty
[24/06/2025, 19.55.35] Yousif Zaid: Not crowded
[24/06/2025, 19.55.38] Yousif Zaid: Boat needs to be crowded
[24/06/2025, 19.55.47] Ems : Exactly
[24/06/2025, 19.55.51] Ems : Nooo
[24/06/2025, 19.55.58] Ems : Jaap got left out
[24/06/2025, 19.56.01] Ems : Shit
[24/06/2025, 19.56.16] Yousif Zaid: Okay delete the message and try again
[24/06/2025, 19.56.20] Yousif Zaid: I call him on the phone
[24/06/2025, 19.56.25] Ems : HAHAHAHHAHAH
[24/06/2025, 19.56.27] Ems : Listen
[24/06/2025, 19.56.30] Yousif Zaid: We’ll beat that fucker to the finish line
[24/06/2025, 19.56.37] Ems : I say I just individually text ppl
[24/06/2025, 19.56.46] Yousif Zaid: It’s beyond too late for that
[24/06/2025, 19.56.47] Ems : Who's the fucker?
[24/06/2025, 19.56.51] Ems : Idc
[24/06/2025, 19.56.56] Yousif Zaid: Emma come on
[24/06/2025, 19.57.12] Ems : I have no clue what you're talking about
[24/06/2025, 19.57.33] Ems : Honestly
[24/06/2025, 19.57.41] Ems : Should I individually text
[24/06/2025, 19.57.44] Ems : Like
[24/06/2025, 19.57.56] Yousif Zaid: Dear god woman
[24/06/2025, 19.58.01] Yousif Zaid: He liked the message already
[24/06/2025, 19.58.31] Yousif Zaid: Like what are we gonna do
[24/06/2025, 19.58.36] Yousif Zaid: Pretend it’s cancelled in the group chat
[24/06/2025, 19.58.48] Ems : ...
[24/06/2025, 19.58.50] Ems : Yes
[24/06/2025, 19.58.58] Yousif Zaid: Then the guy whose name rhymes with bugo sees us post it all on our insta stories
[24/06/2025, 19.59.03] Yousif Zaid: The very next day
[24/06/2025, 19.59.21] Ems : It's summer break we're not gonna see him
[24/06/2025, 19.59.35] Yousif Zaid: I pray to god I never land on your bad side
[24/06/2025, 19.59.37] Ems : Ok I'm joking we probably can't
[24/06/2025, 20.00.27] Yousif Zaid: I feel bad for jaapoket
[24/06/2025, 20.01.15] Ems : He's not being left out
[24/06/2025, 20.01.24] Yousif Zaid: Isn’t he?
[24/06/2025, 20.01.29] Ems : No
[24/06/2025, 20.01.38] Ems : I will individually text if I have to
[24/06/2025, 20.01.53] Ems : I don't want to but if it's a choice between leaving out two people
[24/06/2025, 20.02.10] Yousif Zaid: How much of a choice is it really
[24/06/2025, 20.02.17] Yousif Zaid: Is there some Hugo beef I don’t know about
[24/06/2025, 20.02.50] Ems : Exactly
[24/06/2025, 20.02.55] Ems : Literally nothing
[24/06/2025, 20.03.04] Ems : I just like the other people way more
[24/06/2025, 20.04.42] Yousif Zaid: If I don’t get a text I’m throwing a tantrum
[24/06/2025, 20.06.06] Ems : Now I kind of want to leave you out to see the tantrum
[24/06/2025, 20.06.13] Yousif Zaid: It’s not pretty
[24/06/2025, 21.03.39] Ems : I would bet not
[24/06/2025, 21.08.05] Yousif Zaid: jaap can join but there's no space on the boat
[24/06/2025, 21.08.07] Yousif Zaid: this is heartbreaking
[24/06/2025, 21.18.50] Ems : Yousif I told you I'm not doing that
[24/06/2025, 21.30.44] Yousif Zaid: okay let me hear the game plan then
[24/06/2025, 21.36.48] Ems : I'm working on it
[24/06/2025, 21.36.50] Ems : Ideas?
[24/06/2025, 21.39.45] Yousif Zaid: I drop a comically sized piano on Hugo like in looney tunes
[24/06/2025, 22.27.01] Ems : Please yes
[24/06/2025, 22.27.14] Ems : That's THE game plan
[24/06/2025, 22.32.33] Yousif Zaid: idk. like it depends on how uh
[24/06/2025, 22.32.37] Yousif Zaid: how mean you're willing to be
[24/06/2025, 22.33.09] Yousif Zaid: realistically the only thing to do is to pretend to cancel it and then text us otherwise but like. that's not a nice thing to do
[24/06/2025, 22.44.45] Ems : Yeah I know..
[24/06/2025, 22.52.49] Yousif Zaid: unfortunately i think the only thing to do is to just say it is what it is
[24/06/2025, 22.52.53] Yousif Zaid: jaap was too slow
[24/06/2025, 22.53.33] Yousif Zaid: if you're really a psycho you can ask hugo not to go because you'd rather jaap come
[24/06/2025, 22.53.39] Yousif Zaid: but you're not a psycho
[24/06/2025, 22.59.03] Yousif Zaid: what we COULD do is let everyone who wants to go sign up
[24/06/2025, 22.59.05] Yousif Zaid: and we draw numbers
[24/06/2025, 22.59.07] Yousif Zaid: like a lottery
[24/06/2025, 23.02.33] Ems : That's bad
[24/06/2025, 23.02.47] Yousif Zaid: what part
[24/06/2025, 23.03.29] Ems : Kind of all of it but this
[24/06/2025, 23.03.58] Yousif Zaid: want me to find out the odds of hugo losing and everyone else winning
[24/06/2025, 23.20.09] Ems : Please do
[24/06/2025, 23.23.57] Yousif Zaid: it's a 1/9th
[24/06/2025, 23.24.00] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/06/2025, 23.24.20] Ems : That's too low
[24/06/2025, 23.24.23] Ems : Isn't it?
[24/06/2025, 23.24.31] Yousif Zaid: 11%
[24/06/2025, 23.27.02] Yousif Zaid: honestly i don't think there is anything to do. we will just have to miss jaap and try not to be too sad at his absence
[24/06/2025, 23.27.11] Yousif Zaid: unless you have a piano laying around
[24/06/2025, 23.35.09] Ems : I don't want to be the one to say it though [24/06/2025, 23.35.19] Yousif Zaid: to drag it?
[24/06/2025, 23.35.25] Yousif Zaid: oh
[24/06/2025, 23.35.25] Ems : Keyboard
[24/06/2025, 23.35.33] Yousif Zaid: i mean jaap is a very reasonable man
[24/06/2025, 23.35.46] Yousif Zaid: we just say "whoops all seats filled sorry" and he'll say okay with a smile on his face
[24/06/2025, 23.36.08] Ems : The only problem is that now cami answered as well
[24/06/2025, 23.36.15] Ems : Should we just say so
[24/06/2025, 23.36.16] Ems : Like
[24/06/2025, 23.36.19] Ems : Too bad
[24/06/2025, 23.36.30] Yousif Zaid: yeah?
[24/06/2025, 23.36.35] Yousif Zaid: or get a second boat
[24/06/2025, 23.37.40] Yousif Zaid: first come first serve is more reasonable. honestly the goof up here was writing it to the group chat but that's for next time
[24/06/2025, 23.39.46] Ems : Wait what?
[24/06/2025, 23.40.07] Yousif Zaid: whats up
[24/06/2025, 23.40.25] Ems : The goof here?
[24/06/2025, 23.40.43] Yousif Zaid: "goofing up"
[24/06/2025, 23.40.45] Yousif Zaid: messing up
[24/06/2025, 23.40.59] Ems : Oh yeah
[24/06/2025, 23.41.03] Yousif Zaid: the goof up was writing it to the whole gc
[24/06/2025, 23.41.07] Ems : I didn't know how to go about it
[24/06/2025, 23.41.27] Yousif Zaid: may i suggest like
[24/06/2025, 23.41.35] Ems : I'll take suggestions
[24/06/2025, 23.41.36] Ems : Any
[24/06/2025, 23.41.42] Yousif Zaid: what about the lakes
[24/06/2025, 23.41.50] Ems : Sure
[24/06/2025, 23.42.05] Ems : I wanted the boat on the canals though
[24/06/2025, 23.42.06] Ems : Isl
[24/06/2025, 23.42.10] Ems : Idk*
[24/06/2025, 23.42.22] Yousif Zaid: no i agree going in circles in the lakes is much lamer but like
[24/06/2025, 23.42.35] Yousif Zaid: bluetooth speaker, a case of beer
[24/06/2025, 23.42.37] Yousif Zaid: sunshine
[24/06/2025, 23.42.54] Yousif Zaid: we won't really care where we're going will we?
[24/06/2025, 23.43.10] Ems : You're right
[24/06/2025, 23.43.14] Ems : Obviously
[24/06/2025, 23.43.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/06/2025, 23.43.33] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/06/2025, 23.44.18] Ems : That sounds good
[24/06/2025, 23.44.24] Yousif Zaid: they got a 6 person one, and a 4 person one
[24/06/2025, 23.44.28] Yousif Zaid: two 4 person ones?
[24/06/2025, 23.44.29] Ems : It's crazy that there isn't a 10 person boat
[24/06/2025, 23.44.34] Ems : There must be
[24/06/2025, 23.44.40] Ems : Yes and a swan
[24/06/2025, 23.44.48] Yousif Zaid: who's on the swan
[24/06/2025, 23.45.03] Yousif Zaid: we could also do a 6 person and a 4 person. that adds up to 10 as well
[24/06/2025, 23.45.10] Yousif Zaid: its much cheaper too
[24/06/2025, 23.45.57] Yousif Zaid: they're only open til 20:00 tho
[24/06/2025, 23.48.46] Ems : I think first come first serve is the way to go
[24/06/2025, 23.48.50] Ems : This is marta
[24/06/2025, 23.49.07] Ems : Yah you're right
[24/06/2025, 23.49.13] Ems : I don't mind at this point
[24/06/2025, 23.49.33] Yousif Zaid: look if we're doing the canal boat, marta is 100% right, but these will make it so we can take as many as want to come, and its only a little less fun
[24/06/2025, 23.51.06] Yousif Zaid: isn't it past your bedtime
[24/06/2025, 23.52.33] Ems : I was at the birthday party
[24/06/2025, 23.52.41] Ems : I'm getting ready for bed now
[24/06/2025, 23.52.45] Yousif Zaid: i was wondering
[24/06/2025, 23.52.48] Yousif Zaid: my dad asked me just now
[24/06/2025, 23.52.55] Yousif Zaid: if i wanted to go with him to drop my brother off at the airport at 3 AM
[24/06/2025, 23.53.15] Yousif Zaid: and i said "nah i have to drop mom off at work tommorow morning and i need more than 3 hours sleep"
[24/06/2025, 23.53.33] Yousif Zaid: he said "ooh the princess needs her beauty sleep" and made a meowing noise at me and walked out my room
[24/06/2025, 23.53.42] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
[24/06/2025, 23.53.53] Yousif Zaid: just disrespectful
[24/06/2025, 23.54.03] Ems : That's the funniest thing he could have said
[24/06/2025, 23.54.08] Ems : No he's right
[24/06/2025, 23.54.11] Ems : Don't lie
[24/06/2025, 23.54.20] Ems : Pampered
[24/06/2025, 23.54.27] Yousif Zaid: i am pampered
[24/06/2025, 23.54.37] Ems : Oh yeah
[24/06/2025, 23.58.55] Ems : That party was tiring for no reason
[24/06/2025, 23.59.01] Ems : But anyway
[24/06/2025, 23.59.21] Yousif Zaid: the graduation thing i went to was so bizarre. i was the only one not drinking cuz i had to drive my family home
[24/06/2025, 23.59.25] Yousif Zaid: but i was also the only one dancing
[24/06/2025, 23.59.49] Yousif Zaid: like all my cousins were getting drunk just to sit down and not dance
[25/06/2025, 00.00.01] Yousif Zaid: terrible drunks, no joy in life
[25/06/2025, 00.01.34] Ems : Couldn't be us
[25/06/2025, 00.01.47] Yousif Zaid: could not. i think i'm gonna go to bed
[25/06/2025, 00.01.48] Ems : You're a good sober, that's even better
[25/06/2025, 00.01.57] Ems : Yes same

[25/06/2025, 12.25.17] Ems : It's really appealing
[25/06/2025, 12.25.20] Ems : Idk

[25/06/2025, 12.25.51] Yousif Zaid: It doesn’t appeal to me at all
[25/06/2025, 12.26.06] Ems : Women care more about the future I guess
[25/06/2025, 12.26.12] Yousif Zaid: It’s like how our high school biology class had 2 gay dudes and only women
[25/06/2025, 12.26.32] Ems : Yeahh biology is very women dominated

[06/07/2025, 14.50.14] Yousif Zaid: I sprayed it on at a department store I’m walking around smelling like a glass of orange juice and I kinda like it
[06/07/2025, 14.57.01] Ems : Impersonating a candle
[06/07/2025, 14.57.27] Ems : Buy it then, it's very summery
[06/07/2025, 14.57.52] Ems : Is it more cinnamon orange or shower orange?
[06/07/2025, 14.58.26] Yousif Zaid: Girl the fruit
[06/07/2025, 14.58.41] Ems : Yousif i know

[06/07/2025, 14.59.42] Yousif Zaid: I swear to god buying oranges would just be cheaper
[06/07/2025, 14.59.58] Yousif Zaid: Could just rub one on my neck every morning
[06/07/2025, 15.01.11] Ems : That works too
[06/07/2025, 15.01.15] Ems : How much is it?

[06/07/2025, 15.04.02] Ems : I would probably laugh at you though
[06/07/2025, 15.04.05] Ems : Fair warning
[06/07/2025, 15.04.06] Yousif Zaid: Someone at magasin smells like ground beef
[06/07/2025, 15.04.21] Ems : See now that's not good
[06/07/2025, 15.04.30] Yousif Zaid: Unless you’re hungry ?
[06/07/2025, 15.04.38] Yousif Zaid: Ok this is making me not want to buy it
[06/07/2025, 15.06.15] Ems : If I smell ground beef then amazing but if someone smells like it then it's not that great
[06/07/2025, 15.06.35] Ems : I would just think you had a shower orange
[06/07/2025, 15.07.04] Yousif Zaid: Ok I’ll try find a different summer perfume then
[06/07/2025, 15.07.12] Yousif Zaid: The orange one is too expensive anyway
[06/07/2025, 15.07.18] Yousif Zaid: Could just do shower oranges instead
[06/07/2025, 15.07.33] Ems : I trust your judgement, if you say it's good I believe it
[06/07/2025, 15.07.45] Ems : That is always an option
[06/07/2025, 15.08.38] Yousif Zaid: I grabbed a tester of it you’ll see for yourself
[06/07/2025, 15.11.38] Yousif Zaid: I’m also looking for flared jeans and some shoes, my docs are falling apart

[06/07/2025, 15.25.59] Yousif Zaid: The idea is there but they just don’t fit right in the upper parts.
[06/07/2025, 15.35.39] Yousif Zaid: Some old lady just walked up to me and said “I think it’s a shame that a beautiful looking guy like you should put that disgusting fucking snus in his mouth”
[06/07/2025, 15.35.47] Yousif Zaid: Thanks?
[06/07/2025, 15.42.42] Ems : They look cool but if you're not 100% sure at the store then no

[06/07/2025, 15.43.07] Yousif Zaid: I think the compliment was just social lubricant to talk shit
[06/07/2025, 15.43.14] Yousif Zaid: But we take it!
[06/07/2025, 15.43.49] Ems : A compliment is a compliment idc
[06/07/2025, 15.44.01] Yousif Zaid: We take it!!!!

[06/07/2025, 15.49.28] Yousif Zaid: It’s either grandma or mom you choose
[06/07/2025, 15.50.58] Ems : Fair
[06/07/2025, 15.51.28] Ems : You can choose they will actually adore you
[06/07/2025, 15.51.34] Yousif Zaid: I can’t believe you moved to DENMARK
[06/07/2025, 15.52.20] Ems : Try getting a job here
[06/07/2025, 15.53.28] Yousif Zaid: Danish ppl work their entire lives saving to retire in a place that’s not even half as beautiful as these photos
[06/07/2025, 15.53.49] Yousif Zaid: If I was Italian I’d be fine with being poor. I’d just sit at the beach all day drinking 3 euro spritz

[09/07/2025, 08.05.55] Yousif Zaid: See the selfish part of me wants to say this is a fine sleeping schedule so I can wake up to cake in Italy
[09/07/2025, 08.06.22] Yousif Zaid: Hold on did you go to sleep at 9:30? This might not be too bad

[09/07/2025, 08.32.52] Ems : It's definitely been a journey
[09/07/2025, 08.33.26] Yousif Zaid: Your family is very lucky to have you
[09/07/2025, 08.36.25] Ems : They do get a lot of baked stuff
[09/07/2025, 08.36.47] Ems : But I can be annoying so it's just to counterbalance
[09/07/2025, 08.37.02] Yousif Zaid: I just cannot see this
[09/07/2025, 09.01.44] Ems : You're too kind, you have seen it
[09/07/2025, 10.02.20] Yousif Zaid: If I’ve already SEEN it and not noticed then it can’t be that bad
[09/07/2025, 10.02.35] Yousif Zaid: Soheyl has been making me want to kill myself for 4 years he never baked a cake

[09/07/2025, 22.58.51] Yousif Zaid: Uncanny
[10/07/2025, 08.45.32] Ems : For an Italian schedule it's even that late
[10/07/2025, 08.45.52] Ems : I really can't imagine that

[10/07/2025, 10.08.10] Yousif Zaid: That’s cute. I think the only body modification I would want is some tooth jewellery
[10/07/2025, 10.08.45] Yousif Zaid: If my daughter wanted her ears pierced I think I’d take her to the pharmacy the same day just so I could watch her waddle around with massive fucking earrings
[10/07/2025, 10.09.02] Ems : Are you still in silver or do you want like a little star? I think that could be cool

[10/07/2025, 10.17.58] Ems : I'm still not convinced I'm sorry
[10/07/2025, 10.18.14] Yousif Zaid: Maybe it’s because I’m calling them camel toe shoes
[10/07/2025, 10.18.36] Yousif Zaid: Shit probably, I love weird shit I’ll have a whole list of trinkets by the time I’m out of here

[10/07/2025, 10.28.19] Ems : Wait this is so cool
[10/07/2025, 10.28.33] Ems : How old were you?
[10/07/2025, 10.28.39] Ems : This was 2023 right?
[10/07/2025, 10.37.09] Yousif Zaid: Yes so that would make me 19. The age you are now
[10/07/2025, 10.37.15] Yousif Zaid: Damn
[10/07/2025, 13.02.44] Ems : So crazy
[10/07/2025, 13.04.10] Ems :

[10/07/2025, 13.17.31] Yousif Zaid: Very beautiful, it looks almost like the Middle East
[10/07/2025, 13.17.48] Yousif Zaid: Reminds me of when I would visit my grandparents in Amman, Jordan and go to the roof of their building
[10/07/2025, 18.18.20] Ems : It was really nice, what do you mean the middle east? The architecture?
[10/07/2025, 18.30.18] Yousif Zaid: The colors, mostly
[10/07/2025, 18.30.28] Yousif Zaid: I don’t see such yellow and orange buildings so much anymore
[10/07/2025, 18.51.07] Ems : I Just recieved the letter in the mail and I absolutely adore it. It's so austenian, I think you would've fit right in in the 1800s, and the drawing is the the best thing I've seen in months, I love it. I won't go on about the content because you'll be recieving an answer in the appropriate way soon( it'll be hard to match yours though). It was so so cool to receive a letter, I don't know why we don't do it more often
[10/07/2025, 18.51.46] Ems : Also I think if you had more time at the Michelangelo you would've had the better drawing
[10/07/2025, 18.53.40] Ems : I'm rereading it for the third time, you write so beautifully
[10/07/2025, 19.20.32] Yousif Zaid: I’m really relieved you like it. My face is stuck like this right now: Honestly the second I handed it to the mail dude I started getting shy, so I’m glad. I’m also pleasantly surprised that it arrived so quickly. I was scared that it wouldn’t so I took some photos of it to show you just in case it got lost somehow. [10/07/2025, 19.22.48] Yousif Zaid: Sending a letter is much better than an Instagram reel isn’t it? I’m excited about a response. Want my parents address since I’m staying there for the summer?
[10/07/2025, 19.39.05] Yousif Zaid: I’m fuckin stupid the return address is on the envelope I sent you
[10/07/2025, 20.21.09] Ems : It is so much better
[10/07/2025, 20.21.18] Ems : You'll know once you get mine
[10/07/2025, 20.21.23] Ems : Yes I have it dw
[10/07/2025, 20.23.25] Yousif Zaid: This is just flattery I don’t care that’s a sin
[10/07/2025, 20.26.45] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/07/2025, 20.27.13] Yousif Zaid: My dad said I look like “the assistant of a clown, not even the clown, you blow up the balloons for the clown and the clown folds them”
[10/07/2025, 20.27.36] Yousif Zaid: I doubled over laughing and mom took a photo
[10/07/2025, 21.05.00] Ems : It's not I'm proud of my win so I'm saying I don't know how it would've gone if we'd had more time
[10/07/2025, 21.05.10] Ems : Fuck you for saying I sinned
[10/07/2025, 21.05.21] Ems : Oh he's so right I'm sorry
[10/07/2025, 21.05.34] Yousif Zaid: He really got my ass didn’t he
[10/07/2025, 21.05.42] Ems : Did you wear these out? Serious question
[10/07/2025, 21.05.50] Ems : He did..
[10/07/2025, 21.06.04] Yousif Zaid: 3 times, yes. Back in 2022
[10/07/2025, 21.06.13] Ems : I'm currently having a very serious religious debate with my whole family at the dinner table
[10/07/2025, 21.06.17] Ems : 3?!
[10/07/2025, 21.06.37] Yousif Zaid: What about?
[10/07/2025, 21.06.46] Yousif Zaid: I don’t actually think they’re so bad
[10/07/2025, 21.08.27] Ems : Ok I dare you to wear them in maths next semester
[10/07/2025, 21.08.49] Ems : Church Vs Christianity, it's getting opinionated
[10/07/2025, 21.09.22] Ems : To be fair you might be able to pull it off with this t-shirt and a leather jacket
[10/07/2025, 21.09.27] Ems : And boots
[10/07/2025, 21.09.28] Yousif Zaid: I wouldn’t, I just don’t think they’re terrorism like my parents think. They might suit a woman
[10/07/2025, 21.09.41] Yousif Zaid: I will experiment
[10/07/2025, 21.10.26] Yousif Zaid: We stopped debating things at my house a long time ago. I can be a real smug piece of shit and everyone would get too angry
[10/07/2025, 21.50.43] Ems : I should try it, make an outfit work
[10/07/2025, 21.50.53] Ems : Oh yes
[10/07/2025, 21.51.07] Ems : Mr Google right?
[10/07/2025, 21.51.13] Yousif Zaid: Fuck you
[10/07/2025, 21.51.42] Yousif Zaid: I learned early in life that being right just doesn’t matter if you’re so insufferable you make your own mom lose her appetite at the dinner table
[10/07/2025, 21.51.57] Yousif Zaid: Yes. Also I went for a jog and look who I met
[10/07/2025, 21.52.00] Ems : ...

[10/07/2025, 21.52.17] Ems : I mean I know they think it
[10/07/2025, 21.52.34] Ems : Wait he's so cute
[10/07/2025, 21.52.35] Yousif Zaid: Please don’t start calling me mr google also
[10/07/2025, 21.52.51] Ems : Have you become a runner?
[10/07/2025, 21.53.01] Ems : The cat is so adorable
[10/07/2025, 21.53.20] Yousif Zaid: I try to exercise a bit every day and when I don’t have time to lift I just jog a bit
[10/07/2025, 21.53.39] Yousif Zaid: When I do lift I box also
[10/07/2025, 21.54.00] Ems : I get it, I feel like without school exercise is really needed
[10/07/2025, 21.54.07] Yousif Zaid: My favourite part was tongue kissing my iPhone camera while closing his eyes. The little tramp
[10/07/2025, 21.54.36] Yousif Zaid: I think I just neglect my health when studying and now I’m trying to compensate
[10/07/2025, 21.54.48] Ems : That's one slutty cat
[10/07/2025, 21.54.59] Ems : Damn
[10/07/2025, 21.55.23] Yousif Zaid: He’s even doing the “eyes” right before the kiss like in terrible movies
[10/07/2025, 21.55.37] Ems : Oh no
[10/07/2025, 21.55.39] Ems : The look
[10/07/2025, 21.55.43] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAH
[10/07/2025, 21.56.04] Yousif Zaid: I can’t believe the look is a real thing there’s just no way
[10/07/2025, 21.56.18] Yousif Zaid: I’ve heard of it before but it’s just so silly
[10/07/2025, 21.56.58] Ems : You must have seen it
[10/07/2025, 21.57.04] Ems : Like even random people
[10/07/2025, 21.57.16] Yousif Zaid: I don’t kiss random people
[10/07/2025, 21.57.30] Ems : Bitch I'm not saying I did
[10/07/2025, 21.57.39] Ems : I mean random people kissing EACH OTHER
[10/07/2025, 21.57.53] Yousif Zaid: I don’t watch people kissing each other from the bushes with a pair of binoculars
[10/07/2025, 21.58.10] Ems : Okok
[10/07/2025, 21.58.31] Yousif Zaid: Sorry
[10/07/2025, 21.59.08] Ems : You calling me a creep was really funny
[10/07/2025, 21.59.40] Yousif Zaid: If I ever saw someone do the look in real life I’d ruin the atmosphere by laughing like a hyena
[10/07/2025, 22.07.28] Ems : Honestly same
[10/07/2025, 22.07.47] Yousif Zaid: I hope I’ve never done the look
[10/07/2025, 22.08.03] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/07/2025, 22.08.31] Ems : Is she okay? I have a deep affection for that car
[10/07/2025, 22.08.50] Yousif Zaid: I asked like 3 women driving by if they could let me jump start my car using theirs and they all said no and the first 2 dudes I asked pushed it for me until I could put it in gear and dump the clutch and start it that way and drive to my mechanic
[10/07/2025, 22.09.01] Yousif Zaid: Dudes rock
[10/07/2025, 22.09.20] Yousif Zaid: Yes I pick her up again tommorow morning with a new battery but she will cost me 1000 kr
[10/07/2025, 22.34.10] Ems : Saviours
[10/07/2025, 22.34.20] Ems : That's quite expensive
[10/07/2025, 22.34.39] Ems : Could've gone worse though
[10/07/2025, 22.35.00] Ems : I think I paid like 5000 to get mine fixed
[10/07/2025, 22.35.11] Yousif Zaid: Battery itself is 825. 275 for labour to replace it is a bit steep but not the worst I’ve heard
[10/07/2025, 22.35.43] Yousif Zaid: I spoke to my manager about it and she told me her mechanic charged her 4500 to do the same thing and I didn’t have the heart to tell her that she was scammed by her mechanic because she’s a sweet old lady that doesn’t know about cars
[10/07/2025, 22.38.22] Ems : You did well
[10/07/2025, 22.38.32] Ems : Tbh mine was absolutely broken down
[10/07/2025, 22.38.37] Ems : So it was fair
[10/07/2025, 22.38.48] Yousif Zaid: Claudio told me you oopsied a girls car once and drove off
[10/07/2025, 22.39.10] Ems : I think you were there too when I told the story
[10/07/2025, 22.39.24] Yousif Zaid: I don’t remember so this seemed like news to me
[10/07/2025, 22.39.46] Ems : Also I didn't drive off
I just ignored her texts when she asked about insurance
[10/07/2025, 22.39.46] Ems : And
[10/07/2025, 22.39.50] Ems : It worked
[10/07/2025, 22.39.54] Ems : I don't know how
[10/07/2025, 22.39.59] Yousif Zaid: “It worked” you’re a psycho [10/07/2025, 22.40.06] Ems : She was asking 400 euros for a scratch
[10/07/2025, 22.40.08] Ems : Come on
[10/07/2025, 22.40.21] Yousif Zaid: She’s a scam artist but you’re a psycho
[10/07/2025, 22.40.30] Yousif Zaid: Okay she deserves it
[10/07/2025, 22.40.31] Ems : Whatever she tried a few times and gave up
[10/07/2025, 22.40.35] Ems : It's on her
[10/07/2025, 22.40.41] Yousif Zaid: No no I’m on your side here now
[10/07/2025, 22.40.42] Ems : I'll take it
[10/07/2025, 22.40.48] Ems : Ok good
[10/07/2025, 22.40.51] Ems : Fuck the lady
[10/07/2025, 22.41.10] Yousif Zaid: Dude I was randomly walking down the street and remembered “I thought I could be friends with Sheldon before I met him” and my insides started hurting
[10/07/2025, 22.41.18] Yousif Zaid: Ahhahahahahahahaha
[10/07/2025, 22.41.27] Ems : HAHAHAHHAHAH
[10/07/2025, 22.41.35] Ems : I'll shut up next time I promise
[10/07/2025, 22.41.47] Yousif Zaid: No please I have to hear more of these
[10/07/2025, 22.42.16] Ems : To be fair it was only you and jaap
[10/07/2025, 22.42.21] Ems : And he's judgy
[10/07/2025, 22.42.24] Yousif Zaid: Dmitri
[10/07/2025, 22.42.30] Yousif Zaid: And he’s judgy yes
[10/07/2025, 22.42.33] Ems : Oh fuck I forgot
[10/07/2025, 22.42.40] Yousif Zaid: Jaap is not judgy he wouldn’t say a mean thing about anyone
[10/07/2025, 22.42.49] Ems : Yeah that wasn't nice of me but I stand by it
[10/07/2025, 22.42.55] Ems : Oh you haven't heard him
[10/07/2025, 22.43.05] Yousif Zaid: Being nice isn’t everything in life
[10/07/2025, 22.43.19] Yousif Zaid: There’s a reason that gossipy old ladies are so close to each other
[10/07/2025, 22.44.04] Ems : Very true
[10/07/2025, 22.44.07] Ems : The village ladies
[10/07/2025, 22.44.12] Ems : They're a clan
[10/07/2025, 22.44.15] Yousif Zaid: The balcony ladies
[10/07/2025, 22.45.44] Ems : I kind of admire them
[10/07/2025, 22.45.50] Ems : They're very committed
[10/07/2025, 22.46.00] Yousif Zaid: I would be such a bitch if I was an old woman
[10/07/2025, 22.46.19] Yousif Zaid: Nobody likes mean old men so I have to be nice when I’m old
[10/07/2025, 22.47.25] Ems : I need to as well
[10/07/2025, 22.47.37] Ems : Nobody really likes mean old ladies
[10/07/2025, 22.47.44] Yousif Zaid: They have a charm to them
[10/07/2025, 22.47.44] Ems : You just have to be nice
[10/07/2025, 22.48.06] Yousif Zaid: I’m so gonna end up like those old dudes that stare at construction sites all day
[10/07/2025, 22.48.10] Yousif Zaid: I’m looking forward to it
[10/07/2025, 22.48.56] Ems : You'll get the t-shirt tan line
[10/07/2025, 22.49.32] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna start doing nerd shit now I’ll show you what I meant to show you the other night
[10/07/2025, 22.49.58] Ems : Go
[10/07/2025, 22.52.17] Yousif Zaid: I made a little language model AI thingy and gave it 32,000 names to learn. but it learns based off just two letters at a time. so if you give it "emma" itll memorise like
em
mm
ma
[10/07/2025, 22.53.24] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/07/2025, 22.54.47] Yousif Zaid: "emma" has a log likelihood of 2.5 while "yousif" has 3.2. lower is better
[10/07/2025, 22.56.50] Yousif Zaid: weirdly enough "yemma" is also more common than "yousif" which i think is bullshit
[10/07/2025, 22.57.25] Ems : That's so cool
[10/07/2025, 22.57.51] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/07/2025, 22.57.57] Yousif Zaid: "Janasah" could be a name i guess
[10/07/2025, 22.58.22] Ems : Did you only put western names? Because if you put random names from all over the world I think yous is more common no?
[10/07/2025, 22.58.41] Yousif Zaid: "yousif" is literally in the list so i don't think so
[10/07/2025, 22.58.44] Ems : Yemma is a pretty name say what you will
[10/07/2025, 22.59.10] Ems : Junide is such a good name
[10/07/2025, 22.59.23] Ems : This is so cool how long did it take you
[10/07/2025, 22.59.33] Yousif Zaid: right now the model only works off statistics. like it counts all the 2 letter combinations and i made a probability distribution
[10/07/2025, 22.59.38] Yousif Zaid: which is why it's so shit
[10/07/2025, 22.59.42] Ems : I JUST READ YOUR ANSWER TO IT [10/07/2025, 22.59.51] Ems : HahahahahHH
[10/07/2025, 23.00.14] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/07/2025, 23.00.23] Yousif Zaid: full stops are starts and ends of names
[10/07/2025, 23.00.44] Yousif Zaid: so all the names start with . and then it looks at the first row and based off the counts it samples from that to pick the first letter, then it does the same thing for the row for whichever letter we just picked
[10/07/2025, 23.01.04] Yousif Zaid: 45 minutes?
[10/07/2025, 23.01.14] Ems : Wait this is awesome
[10/07/2025, 23.01.37] Yousif Zaid: i AI generated the table because there's just no way
[10/07/2025, 23.01.55] Ems : No the coding I mean
[10/07/2025, 23.02.18] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/07/2025, 23.02.20] Yousif Zaid: maybe we get more natural sounding names
[10/07/2025, 23.02.26] Ems : No wonder they pay you to do this shit
[10/07/2025, 23.02.38] Yousif Zaid: the shit i do for money is way simpler than this
[10/07/2025, 23.02.51] Yousif Zaid: i'm a digital janitor at work, but this stuff i can be proud of
[10/07/2025, 23.03.11] Ems : I wish I could fully understand this
[10/07/2025, 23.03.25] Yousif Zaid: you already know all the math that makes it work
[10/07/2025, 23.03.27] Yousif Zaid: you do understand it
[10/07/2025, 23.04.06] Yousif Zaid: this is basically just one long nested function that we do the chain rule on like 5000 times
[10/07/2025, 23.04.14] Yousif Zaid: then we do the gradient method from math 1b
[10/07/2025, 23.04.15] Yousif Zaid: that's it
[10/07/2025, 23.05.15] Ems : Ok i think I kind of get it
[10/07/2025, 23.05.26] Ems : So can you calculate the most common?
[10/07/2025, 23.05.49] Yousif Zaid: the most common name?
[10/07/2025, 23.06.07] Ems : Yeah I don't know
Cause what you're doing is the opposite
[10/07/2025, 23.06.16] Ems : Calculating how common
[10/07/2025, 23.06.26] Ems : I wondered if it worked the other way
[10/07/2025, 23.06.40] Yousif Zaid: i can give it a name and itll give me the likelihood. i think since this model is so shit the actual "best likelihood" we'll get is like
[10/07/2025, 23.06.46] Yousif Zaid: a name like
[10/07/2025, 23.07.09] Yousif Zaid: yeah like the name "n" is considered to be 4 times more likely than "emma"
[10/07/2025, 23.07.13] Yousif Zaid: and that's because so name names end with n
[10/07/2025, 23.07.45] Yousif Zaid: the name "a" is 9 times more likely than "emma" cause so many names start with a
[10/07/2025, 23.07.59] Yousif Zaid: but of course nobody is called "a". this is why my model is shit and i need to do better
[10/07/2025, 23.08.15] Ems : This is awesome
[10/07/2025, 23.08.20] Ems : Truly
[10/07/2025, 23.09.08] Yousif Zaid: The course I’m following ends with me making chatgpt from 2021 so save the compliments for that
[10/07/2025, 23.09.26] Ems : You're being bashful
[10/07/2025, 23.09.36] Yousif Zaid: Yes ma’am
[10/07/2025, 23.09.35] Ems : But ok I'm curious to see how that goes
[10/07/2025, 23.10.10] Yousif Zaid: Alright I was gonna do nerd shit but my mom is travelling tommorow and wants to watch a movie with me
[10/07/2025, 23.10.44] Ems : Have fun
I'm gonna read and sleep

[11/07/2025, 15.14.29] Ems : I'm currently taking the train I used to take to school to go into town and I'm getting ptsd

[12/07/2025, 22.35.22] Yousif Zaid: might not be such a great impression on your family
[12/07/2025, 22.35.28] Ems : You might just get a chance to
[12/07/2025, 22.35.38] Yousif Zaid: "what did you guys think of yousif?" "well he was torn apart 12 hours after we met him but he was otherwise nice"
[12/07/2025, 22.35.41] Ems : Eh who cares
[12/07/2025, 22.35.50] Ems : HAHAHAHHAHAHA
[12/07/2025, 22.36.35] Ems : No you have to see Naples first so the colosseum fight has to be postponed
[12/07/2025, 22.36.50] Yousif Zaid: what would you say is the nicest place we're gonna see?
[12/07/2025, 22.37.48] Yousif Zaid: bologna, forli, rome, naples, castallamare di stabia, caserta, banio regio, sienna, pisa, florence, san marino
[12/07/2025, 22.38.16] Ems : Ok nicest in general I'd say maybe Florence or Rome
[12/07/2025, 22.38.19] Ems : Like visually
[12/07/2025, 22.38.31] Ems : But vibes wise definitely Naples
[12/07/2025, 22.38.39] Ems : Bagno Reggio is also very beautiful
[12/07/2025, 22.38.50] Yousif Zaid: okay. claudio speaks of naples like it's afghanistan but i suspect he's just a racist
[12/07/2025, 22.39.03] Ems : You got it
[12/07/2025, 22.39.17] Ems : I don't think he's ever been south of Forlì
[12/07/2025, 22.39.20] Ems : Too much mafia
[12/07/2025, 22.39.22] Yousif Zaid: i just had a thought; when we're in rome is your bed time gonna be 10:30 pm
[12/07/2025, 22.39.31] Ems : Maybe
[12/07/2025, 22.39.35] Ems : We'll see
[12/07/2025, 22.39.51] Ems : No I'm joking obviously not
[12/07/2025, 22.39.52] Yousif Zaid: okay i will sneak out of the house like a teenager at a sleepover
[12/07/2025, 22.39.58] Ems : Fuck you
[12/07/2025, 22.40.09] Yousif Zaid: i'll get home from the club at around the same time you wake up to bake cake
[12/07/2025, 22.40.24] Yousif Zaid: i'll say hi in the kitchen, go to sleep, and wake up when the cake is ready
[12/07/2025, 22.40.30] Ems : At that point you wouldn't get any cake
[12/07/2025, 22.40.38] Ems : So consider carefully
[12/07/2025, 22.40.47] Yousif Zaid: your grandmother who will adore me will force you to give me a slice
[12/07/2025, 22.41.09] Yousif Zaid: hold on wait
[12/07/2025, 22.42.04] Ems : If you think so
[12/07/2025, 22.42.16] Ems : I honestly think she wouldn't give a shit
[12/07/2025, 22.42.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[12/07/2025, 22.42.24] Yousif Zaid: hHhahahahhahaha i found pictures of me and my ex's grandma
[12/07/2025, 22.42.35] Ems : HAHAHHAHAHAH
[12/07/2025, 22.42.38] Ems : This is so cute
[12/07/2025, 22.42.44] Ems : She looks so nice
[12/07/2025, 22.42.50] Yousif Zaid: shit happens every time i visit someones folks
[12/07/2025, 22.43.00] Yousif Zaid: they were afraid she was gonna be racist
[12/07/2025, 22.43.15] Yousif Zaid: i show up to the apartment, their entire family is ines's height including the grandpa so i'm like a giant
[12/07/2025, 22.43.26] Yousif Zaid: i might have already mentioned this to you
[12/07/2025, 22.43.30] Ems : I might shit talk you so you have a hard time getting them to like you
[12/07/2025, 22.44.00] Yousif Zaid: she sees me and goes "oh he's so handsome!" in slovak and at dinner she stands next to where i'm sitting and strokes my cheek while i eat her food
[12/07/2025, 22.44.09] Ems : It looks like the grandma adores you
[12/07/2025, 22.44.14] Ems : Awww
[12/07/2025, 22.44.21] Ems : That's adorable
[12/07/2025, 22.44.34] Yousif Zaid: apparently the more of their food you eat the bigger a compliment
[12/07/2025, 22.44.45] Yousif Zaid: so obviously they felt very complimented
[12/07/2025, 22.44.56] Yousif Zaid: short of lying i don't think you could
[12/07/2025, 22.45.02] Yousif Zaid: unless you mention how many cigarettes i give you
[12/07/2025, 22.45.29] Yousif Zaid: don't do that
[12/07/2025, 22.45.38] Ems : I wouldn't do that to either of us
[12/07/2025, 22.45.43] Ems : That's self sabotage
[12/07/2025, 22.45.52] Yousif Zaid: didn't think of that
[12/07/2025, 22.46.09] Yousif Zaid: i'm a lovely young man itll be okay
[12/07/2025, 22.46.51] Ems : Yes nothing to worry about
[12/07/2025, 22.48.14] Yousif Zaid: anyway i'll do nerd shit and update you probably by the time you're asleep. you go and pack. have fun
[12/07/2025, 22.48.56] Ems : Go do your thing, I'll pack tomorrow I can't be bothered now
[12/07/2025, 22.49.09] Yousif Zaid: you're gonna regret this
[12/07/2025, 22.50.06] Ems : I know
[12/07/2025, 22.50.16] Ems : But I wake up early it's fine
[13/07/2025, 00.02.33] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 00.10.56] Yousif Zaid: okay i'll try to keep this not too nerdy, but:
i took all of the 2 letter examples from the 32,000 names, and encoded them into "one-hot" vectors. basically its a vector of the entire alphabet but the corresponding letter is 1 and the rest is 0. so "a" is the vector [0, 1, 0,...,0,0] (its 27 long, 26 letters + a full stop to show beginnings and ends of words)
[13/07/2025, 00.12.33] Yousif Zaid: You deleted this message.
[13/07/2025, 00.13.09] Yousif Zaid: you do this matrix multiplication, and calculate how ass it is
[13/07/2025, 00.13.26] Yousif Zaid: do the gradient method to minimise how ass it is by changing the entries in our W vectors
[13/07/2025, 00.14.49] Yousif Zaid: for the 2 letter model we were able to basically just do that statistics table i showed you and calculate the probability distributions to sample letters and make names. this time i made a random probability distribution and used the gradient method to "learn" the actual probabilities
[13/07/2025, 00.15.53] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 00.16.26] Yousif Zaid: but with the gradient method version we can make it look at 3 letter combos which should work better very easily, its just a few changes, which is what i've done here
[13/07/2025, 00.22.13] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 00.22.40] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 00.22.53] Yousif Zaid: i'm sorry for this wall of text i'm going to sleep now
[13/07/2025, 09.30.53] Ems : Yousif this is so cool
[13/07/2025, 09.31.11] Ems : I'll have to re-read it to fully understand but really nice
[13/07/2025, 09.31.32] Ems : Also I enjoy seeing you bully your computer
[13/07/2025, 09.40.06] Yousif Zaid: Might name my kid Calyhades. Also Amanna is the nickname of my little brother
[13/07/2025, 09.41.50] Yousif Zaid: Did you pack successfully?
[13/07/2025, 09.46.50] Ems : video omitted
[13/07/2025, 09.46.52] Ems : On my way
[13/07/2025, 09.47.22] Yousif Zaid: Are you texting and driving to sorrento right now?
[13/07/2025, 09.51.51] Yousif Zaid: Drive safe, and update me on the camping trip
[13/07/2025, 10.01.43] Ems : No I just drove to the train station to meet my friends
[13/07/2025, 10.01.47] Ems : I will
[13/07/2025, 10.05.58] Ems : Have you watched squid game?
[13/07/2025, 10.07.45] Yousif Zaid: I watched the very first one that came out during Covid
[13/07/2025, 10.07.50] Yousif Zaid: Why?
[13/07/2025, 11.13.01] Ems : Because I watched the third and literally nobody's seen it
[13/07/2025, 11.13.13] Ems : I wanted to know your opinions
[13/07/2025, 11.13.21] Yousif Zaid: There’s a third?
[13/07/2025, 11.16.42] Ems : It came out like 2 weeks ago
[13/07/2025, 11.19.30] Yousif Zaid: Didn’t even know. You know what also came out? Third season of the bear
[13/07/2025, 11.19.32] Yousif Zaid: You seen that?
[13/07/2025, 11.26.26] Ems : Oh I will watch it on the boat
[13/07/2025, 11.26.30] Ems : Not yet
[13/07/2025, 11.26.39] Yousif Zaid: It’s so fucking good
[13/07/2025, 11.26.42] Ems : I've been slacking off with shows
[13/07/2025, 11.27.05] Yousif Zaid: Feel like I haven’t seen enough good movies
[13/07/2025, 11.27.16] Yousif Zaid: When are you going on the boat
[13/07/2025, 11.27.19] Yousif Zaid: Is it like a cruise?
[13/07/2025, 11.48.46] Ems : No a catamaran

[13/07/2025, 11.49.20] Yousif Zaid: I have a pretty good list
[13/07/2025, 11.51.12] Yousif Zaid: You’ve seen the grand Budapest hotel right?
[13/07/2025, 11.51.38] Yousif Zaid: That’s sick. Is it just your family?
[13/07/2025, 12.23.09] Ems : Just half
[13/07/2025, 12.23.16] Ems : We were tired and went to sleep
[13/07/2025, 12.23.25] Yousif Zaid: How do you watch half of that movie
[13/07/2025, 12.23.40] Ems : Yup and a few other people who drive the boat
[13/07/2025, 12.24.05] Yousif Zaid: Let me send you the movie list hold on
[13/07/2025, 12.24.21] Ems : You're actually right, I started in April with my dad and then I went back to Denmark
[13/07/2025, 12.24.27] Ems : So we never got to finish it
[13/07/2025, 12.24.43] Yousif Zaid: Okay we watch twilight and also finish that because it’s cinema
[13/07/2025, 12.24.51] Ems : Yes please
[13/07/2025, 12.26.01] Ems : Deal
[13/07/2025, 12.26.32] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 12.26.50] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 12.34.45] Ems : I will definitely use this
[13/07/2025, 12.34.47] Ems : Also
[13/07/2025, 12.34.53] Ems : Can I watch frozen with you?
[13/07/2025, 12.35.21] Yousif Zaid: Hahahahaha of course
[13/07/2025, 12.36.05] Ems : I've never seen the Godfather either
[13/07/2025, 12.36.16] Ems : I hear it's amazing
[13/07/2025, 12.45.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s pretty good yeah. It’s one of those “guy” movies but like, done well
[13/07/2025, 12.46.07] Yousif Zaid: Shit this list is old I’m mentioning hana in there
[13/07/2025, 12.46.17] Yousif Zaid: Let me remove that real quick hold on
[13/07/2025, 12.47.01] Ems : Ok but I picked twilight to show you, so you have to pick one that I should really watch
[13/07/2025, 12.47.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 12.47.37] Yousif Zaid: Easily the big lebowski
[13/07/2025, 12.47.43] Yousif Zaid: I quote it 24/7 but nobody gets it
[13/07/2025, 12.48.38] Yousif Zaid: That movie has done so much for my lexicon
[13/07/2025, 12.50.31] Yousif Zaid: Whenever someone tries joining a conversation halfway through and asking questions I’ve already answered I say “you’re out of your fuckin element Donnie” and nobody gets it
[13/07/2025, 12.57.25] Ems : You ALWAYS do that
[13/07/2025, 12.57.59] Yousif Zaid: It’s a good bit you’ll see
[13/07/2025, 12.58.13] Yousif Zaid: Also if we watch that movie I will make us White Russians because the protagonist always drinks them
[13/07/2025, 16.08.34] Ems : Deal
[13/07/2025, 21.29.26] Ems :

[13/07/2025, 21.29.44] Ems : All set up and ready to smoke
[13/07/2025, 21.30.27] Ems : Obviously drinking gin lemons
[13/07/2025, 22.38.17] Yousif Zaid: Looks fun
[13/07/2025, 22.38.20] Yousif Zaid: Here’s what I did today

[13/07/2025, 22.42.14] Yousif Zaid: Took Laura out to dinner in north sjelland
[13/07/2025, 23.39.19] Ems : It looks so amazing
[13/07/2025, 23.39.30] Ems : The duck at the end is the best
[13/07/2025, 23.39.48] Yousif Zaid: I’ve named him George
[13/07/2025, 23.39.57] Ems : Also the pictures in the car are great
[13/07/2025, 23.39.59] Yousif Zaid: He lives in the town of gilleleje
[13/07/2025, 23.40.09] Ems : That's a very fitting name
[13/07/2025, 23.40.16] Yousif Zaid: I accidentally went so fast I could lose my license
[13/07/2025, 23.40.26] Yousif Zaid: I’m having a hard time falling asleep I’m quite paranoid
[13/07/2025, 23.40.38] Yousif Zaid: I’m like 90% sure I didn’t get caught
[13/07/2025, 23.41.19] Ems : Is it a spot where they usually put speed machines?
[13/07/2025, 23.41.34] Ems : You're going to be just fine
[13/07/2025, 23.41.37] Ems : I trust
[13/07/2025, 23.41.41] Yousif Zaid: I had Dmitri check on the map and he said there shouldn’t be any
[13/07/2025, 23.41.42] Yousif Zaid: Idk
[13/07/2025, 23.41.46] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/07/2025, 23.41.53] Yousif Zaid: In my defense I was listening to this
[13/07/2025, 23.43.01] Yousif Zaid: I’m almost sure I am but the consequences would be fucking disastrous
[13/07/2025, 23.44.24] Ems : Okok what was the speed?
[13/07/2025, 23.44.32] Yousif Zaid: Uhhhhh
[13/07/2025, 23.44.41] Yousif Zaid: Might have been 118
[13/07/2025, 23.44.44] Yousif Zaid: In a 60.
[13/07/2025, 23.47.26] Yousif Zaid: They take away the car if you double the limit.
[13/07/2025, 23.47.42] Yousif Zaid: Which I didn’t!
[13/07/2025, 23.47.55] Yousif Zaid: And even then I’m almost sure I didn’t get caught
[13/07/2025, 23.47.54] Ems : Right, I really hope it actually was 118
[13/07/2025, 23.48.02] Yousif Zaid: Don’t fucking say that to me
[13/07/2025, 23.48.14] Ems : I'm being honest
[13/07/2025, 23.48.23] Yousif Zaid: I let go of the gas when I saw 118
[13/07/2025, 23.48.32] Ems : Even if you were I'm sure the camera didn't catch it
[13/07/2025, 23.48.35] Yousif Zaid: Also the car overestimates its own speed by 6 [13/07/2025, 23.48.50] Ems : You're making excuses I can tell
[13/07/2025, 23.48.54] Yousif Zaid: And the cameras have a 10% margin of error
[13/07/2025, 23.49.02] Yousif Zaid: It’s called COPING
[13/07/2025, 23.49.17] Ems : ..
[13/07/2025, 23.49.20] Yousif Zaid: So realistically I’m probably clocked at 105
[13/07/2025, 23.49.31] Ems : Ok that's girl math
[13/07/2025, 23.49.35] Ems : Don't you dare
[13/07/2025, 23.49.39] Yousif Zaid: Seriously the last time I got a ticket it said “you were going anywhere between 126 and 155”
[13/07/2025, 23.49.51] Yousif Zaid: Really I was doing 140 but they gave me the punishment for 126
[13/07/2025, 23.50.00] Yousif Zaid: Yes it’s fucking girl math my life is on the line
[13/07/2025, 23.50.15] Yousif Zaid: Because if the car is taken away I will actually kill my self and that is not a threat that’s a promise
[13/07/2025, 23.51.30] Ems : Lucky
[13/07/2025, 23.51.39] Yousif Zaid: It’s the law
[13/07/2025, 23.51.39] Ems : Ok you're just dramatic
[13/07/2025, 23.51.52] Yousif Zaid: Emma if they take away the audi they will sell it
[13/07/2025, 23.51.55] Yousif Zaid: We just lose it
[13/07/2025, 23.51.57] Yousif Zaid: Permanently
[13/07/2025, 23.52.12] Yousif Zaid: Then I turn myself into a ceiling decoration and Claudio finds me
[13/07/2025, 23.52.20] Yousif Zaid: You are allowed my cool clothes when I’m gone
[13/07/2025, 23.52.46] Ems : He would be scarred for life
[13/07/2025, 23.52.53] Yousif Zaid: Tough shit
[13/07/2025, 23.53.14] Ems : That is still a pretty big part in your will
[13/07/2025, 23.53.22] Yousif Zaid: What else you want
[13/07/2025, 23.54.41] Ems : No I'm saying I appreciate it, it's a pretty important part of it
[13/07/2025, 23.54.50] Yousif Zaid: I know I’m just asking
[13/07/2025, 23.54.59] Yousif Zaid: Take the books also
[13/07/2025, 23.55.03] Ems : Ok then your books
[13/07/2025, 23.55.09] Ems : Yeah thanks
[13/07/2025, 23.55.11] Yousif Zaid: Great minds.
[13/07/2025, 23.55.14] Ems : I'll take them
[13/07/2025, 23.55.18] Ems : Exactly
[13/07/2025, 23.55.26] Yousif Zaid: I’ll be fine
[13/07/2025, 23.55.29] Yousif Zaid: I think I’ll be fine
[13/07/2025, 23.55.35] Yousif Zaid: I won’t have to kill myself
[13/07/2025, 23.55.44] Yousif Zaid: Say it with me
[13/07/2025, 23.56.02] Ems : You'll be just fine
[13/07/2025, 23.56.11] Ems : Literally nobody's noticed
[13/07/2025, 23.56.20] Ems : I'd be really surprised
[13/07/2025, 23.56.23] Yousif Zaid: No one noticed [13/07/2025, 23.56.31] Ems : Things usually work out for you
[13/07/2025, 23.56.37] Ems : I SUNG THAT IN MY HEAS [13/07/2025, 23.56.41] Yousif Zaid: That’s true. Winners win
[13/07/2025, 23.56.45] Yousif Zaid: They keep winning
[13/07/2025, 23.56.58] Yousif Zaid: Great minds!!!!!!
[13/07/2025, 23.57.15] Ems : So sassy
[13/07/2025, 23.57.21] Ems : Yes
[13/07/2025, 23.57.23] Yousif Zaid: No but it’s actual life advice
[13/07/2025, 23.57.35] Yousif Zaid: Be a winner. Winners win and they keep winning. That’s all it takes
[13/07/2025, 23.57.43] Yousif Zaid: You’re a winner
[13/07/2025, 23.57.47] Yousif Zaid: You’ll keep winning
[13/07/2025, 23.58.09] Yousif Zaid: I need a cigarette
[13/07/2025, 23.59.17] Ems : I'll keep it in mind
[13/07/2025, 23.59.22] Ems : We hope so
[13/07/2025, 23.59.37] Yousif Zaid: I know so. I can tell with these things
[13/07/2025, 23.59.46] Ems : image omitted
[14/07/2025, 00.00.05] Ems : I hope you're right
[14/07/2025, 00.00.08] Ems : We'll see
[14/07/2025, 00.00.17] Yousif Zaid: I would do many things for a Marlboro gold right now
[14/07/2025, 00.01.17] Ems : How long since you've smoked?
[14/07/2025, 00.01.29] Yousif Zaid: Uhhhhh
[14/07/2025, 00.01.32] Ems : These are honestly for the weed
[14/07/2025, 00.01.35] Ems : I'll be honest
[14/07/2025, 00.01.56] Yousif Zaid: 10 days
[14/07/2025, 00.02.07] Yousif Zaid: If I don’t count the boys trip cigs, since you left
[14/07/2025, 00.03.18] Ems : You've been really focusing on your health huh
[14/07/2025, 00.03.36] Yousif Zaid: The more likely culprit is the dog training
[14/07/2025, 00.03.37] Ems : I feel like shit cause I've been smoking vapes
[14/07/2025, 00.03.39] Ems : A lot
[14/07/2025, 00.03.48] Ems : Yeah I guess
[14/07/2025, 00.03.57] Yousif Zaid: Those have lead in them. Better to smoke cigs
[14/07/2025, 00.04.06] Yousif Zaid: That’s probably still not true [14/07/2025, 00.04.33] Ems : I swear I smoked a cigarette today, and I haven't since Denmark, I swear I thought it wasn't as good
[14/07/2025, 00.04.50] Yousif Zaid: Maybe you’ve been dog trained also
[14/07/2025, 00.04.57] Ems : Like the second hand smoke story
[14/07/2025, 00.05.01] Ems : Maybe
[14/07/2025, 00.05.18] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[14/07/2025, 00.05.33] Yousif Zaid: This is my dad guarding Danish ambassadors in Iraq during the war
[14/07/2025, 00.05.49] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[14/07/2025, 00.06.07] Yousif Zaid: Second from the right
[14/07/2025, 00.06.20] Ems : This is so so cool
[14/07/2025, 00.06.31] Ems : Yeah I recognised
[14/07/2025, 00.06.48] Ems : You look kind of similar
[14/07/2025, 00.06.54] Yousif Zaid: Actually he was in a documentary last year
[14/07/2025, 00.07.07] Yousif Zaid: They filmed his interview 2 years ago in my living room
[14/07/2025, 00.07.22] Yousif Zaid: I walked downstairs on a Saturday morning in my underwear and opened the door to the living room
[14/07/2025, 00.07.33] Yousif Zaid: Entire camera crew and lighting crew turns around
[14/07/2025, 00.08.27] Yousif Zaid: I looked at them and went “hey”
[14/07/2025, 00.08.34] Ems : I think you said once. I didn't I realized how unaware you were hahahahah
[14/07/2025, 00.09.08] Ems : Does your dad like how the documentary turned out?
[14/07/2025, 00.09.10] Yousif Zaid: My dad was in a suit and all
[14/07/2025, 00.09.21] Yousif Zaid: Yeah they didn’t misrepresent what he said or anything
[14/07/2025, 00.09.47] Ems : I would really like to see his interview once
[14/07/2025, 00.09.47] Yousif Zaid: When we watched it he would get mad at the others that were interviewed that disagreed with him politically
[14/07/2025, 00.09.54] Yousif Zaid: He would swear at the TV it was hilarious
[14/07/2025, 00.10.09] Yousif Zaid: We’ll sit down and do it one day
[14/07/2025, 00.11.46] Yousif Zaid: Assuming I haven’t killed myself by the time we get back to dtu
[14/07/2025, 00.12.59] Yousif Zaid: How is it?
[14/07/2025, 00.15.22] Ems : Is it only because of the car? [14/07/2025, 00.15.39] Ems : I swear I'll kill autocorrect
[14/07/2025, 00.15.41] Yousif Zaid: Yes otherwise I have a lot to live for
[14/07/2025, 00.15.57] Ems : Actually really good
[14/07/2025, 00.16.11] Ems : Exactly, not worth it
[14/07/2025, 00.16.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[14/07/2025, 00.16.52] Ems : Honestly I think kind of
[14/07/2025, 00.17.01] Ems : I had to sing a whole song on a dare
[14/07/2025, 00.17.21] Yousif Zaid: You’re a lovely singer I’m sure it was good
[14/07/2025, 00.17.23] Yousif Zaid: What song
[14/07/2025, 00.19.09] Ems : It was a Beatles one, but a friend helped
[14/07/2025, 00.37.52] Yousif Zaid: On a dare. Playing truth or dare like children. 19 year olds
[14/07/2025, 00.37.58] Yousif Zaid: I remember those times
[14/07/2025, 07.20.12] Ems : It was a board game, more like old people
[14/07/2025, 08.04.39] Yousif Zaid: Shhhhh let me have this
[14/07/2025, 08.06.22] Ems : No you're way too smug about being a year older
[14/07/2025, 08.06.47] Yousif Zaid: I’m not smug I feel ancient
[14/07/2025, 08.07.11] Yousif Zaid: My bones creak
[14/07/2025, 08.09.36] Ems : Being 21 years old is getting to be a lot
[14/07/2025, 08.10.07] Ems : I really don't know how I'll celebrate my birthday, I don't know if I like turning 20
[14/07/2025, 08.10.12] Yousif Zaid: Gramps is turning 22 in January
[14/07/2025, 08.10.43] Yousif Zaid: 20 is a nice number
[14/07/2025, 08.11.18] Ems : It's not that bad
[14/07/2025, 08.11.24] Yousif Zaid: 27 is one of those not nice numbers for example
[14/07/2025, 08.11.29] Ems : 22 is still fine, I would get worried at 26
[14/07/2025, 08.11.33] Yousif Zaid: 28 is a fine number
[14/07/2025, 08.11.42] Ems : True
[14/07/2025, 08.11.51] Yousif Zaid: 29 is a bad number again
[14/07/2025, 08.11.52] Ems : Neither is 29
[14/07/2025, 08.11.56] Ems : Exactly
[14/07/2025, 08.12.00] Yousif Zaid: Great minds
[14/07/2025, 08.12.21] Yousif Zaid: My little brother makes me feel like an actual senior citizen
[14/07/2025, 08.12.37] Ems : It's either great minds or equally stupid
[14/07/2025, 08.12.46] Ems : How is America?
[14/07/2025, 08.12.59] Yousif Zaid: Idk if it’s the sun over there or what but like
[14/07/2025, 08.13.28] Yousif Zaid: My whole life I’ve secretly felt that I was the better looking brother, but I video called him the other day and he was absurdly handsome
[14/07/2025, 08.13.45] Yousif Zaid: Like he looks way better than me
[14/07/2025, 08.19.01] Ems : I think it's just that when someone is away they get a glow about them
[14/07/2025, 08.19.08] Ems : Like away on their own
[14/07/2025, 08.19.34] Yousif Zaid: If he’s still this handsome 2 weeks after he’s back I’ll have to kill him [14/07/2025, 08.20.05] Ems : Hahahahahahah gotta keep appearances up
[14/07/2025, 08.20.26] Yousif Zaid: Cain and Abel but cain slew Abel because he had nice curly hair
[14/07/2025, 08.20.44] Ems : video omitted
[14/07/2025, 08.20.46] Ems : Oh yeah
[14/07/2025, 08.21.44] Yousif Zaid: Spent 10 seconds trying to figure out what book that is instead of watching the video
[14/07/2025, 08.22.07] Ems : Guesses?
[14/07/2025, 08.22.50] Yousif Zaid: Well I read the words central London and there’s actual punctuation so it’s not blood meridian
[14/07/2025, 08.23.04] Yousif Zaid: Otherwise its probably that book from before that’s like 6 short stories
[14/07/2025, 08.24.18] Ems : image omitted
[14/07/2025, 08.24.36] Ems : It didn't fit in my bag
[14/07/2025, 08.24.40] Yousif Zaid: You know I’ve never read it
[14/07/2025, 08.24.58] Yousif Zaid: How is that
[14/07/2025, 08.25.06] Ems : Same I'll let you know how It is, if it's good I'll lend it
[14/07/2025, 08.25.26] Yousif Zaid: I think you have my copy of for whom the bell tolls btw it’s not in my room
[14/07/2025, 08.26.58] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna try my best to finish the brothers this week. It’s been over a year
[14/07/2025, 08.31.29] Ems : When I came to your house you gave me blood meridian, the old man and the sea and the slaughterhouse five
[14/07/2025, 08.31.49] Yousif Zaid: Then it must be at my apartment
[14/07/2025, 08.31.57] Ems : Do you remember giving it to me?
[14/07/2025, 08.32.03] Yousif Zaid: Nope
[14/07/2025, 08.32.35] Ems : If it's not at the apartment I'll buy it so I can read it and then I'll give it to you
[14/07/2025, 08.33.00] Yousif Zaid: I have quite a bit of affection for my copy, I hope I can find it. Thank you tho
[14/07/2025, 08.33.13] Yousif Zaid: After the brothers I think I’ll read something more lighthearted
[14/07/2025, 08.33.24] Yousif Zaid: I can’t do another 800 pager about spiritual redemption
[14/07/2025, 08.35.39] Ems : I'm fairly sure I saw it at the apartment
[14/07/2025, 08.35.50] Ems : Yes fair enough
[14/07/2025, 09.57.18] Yousif Zaid: I’m pleasantly surprised to find that Cornell has every single course I need for exchange
[14/07/2025, 10.36.06] Ems : That's really good
[14/07/2025, 10.36.19] Ems : Did you discard Asia?
[14/07/2025, 10.36.29] Yousif Zaid: No I just haven’t looked around enough yet
[14/07/2025, 10.36.38] Yousif Zaid: We can still learn Korean or Japanese or whatever
[14/07/2025, 10.38.31] Yousif Zaid: Also I’m gonna do future energy because I’m a pussy
[14/07/2025, 10.38.53] Ems : I feel like American unis aren't the best right now
[14/07/2025, 10.38.54] Ems : I'm thinking Korea Singapore or Hong kong
[14/07/2025, 10.38.54] Ems : But it's really good that Cornell has everything you need
[14/07/2025, 10.39.06] Ems : Mmm
[14/07/2025, 10.39.14] Ems : Have you decided for sure?
[14/07/2025, 10.39.41] Yousif Zaid: Yeah I think so. The “extra stuff” I added instead turned out to be mostly unhelpful stuff
[14/07/2025, 10.39.52] Yousif Zaid: Like cyber systems courses that I can just self teach or whatever
[14/07/2025, 10.40.16] Yousif Zaid: Future gets me engineering physics guarantee which kind of aligns with what I want in some sense. It’s a decent backup plan
[14/07/2025, 10.40.43] Yousif Zaid: Of course I will look at these also
[14/07/2025, 10.50.39] Ems : Yes maybe that's smart
[14/07/2025, 10.50.54] Ems : Then you're not being a pussy you're just being smart about it
[14/07/2025, 10.51.37] Yousif Zaid: Still feels like I’m being a pussy but yes. I will start sending emails to the Asians
[14/07/2025, 10.51.51] Yousif Zaid: “Ni hao,
I am Yousif, a general engineer student-“
[14/07/2025, 10.52.20] Ems : Are you 100% sure you want to go into electrical? If not it's good to take future
[14/07/2025, 10.52.25] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAH
[14/07/2025, 10.53.10] Ems : I know you hate these questions but still
[14/07/2025, 10.54.28] Yousif Zaid: I mean as sure as I can be. You never know, I might take the courses and despise it but it sounds intriguing
[14/07/2025, 10.55.21] Yousif Zaid: If I don’t get in to electrical (I will, i can feel it in my stomach) and I’m forced to do engineering physics I’d go with the nano systems route, learn how computer silicon is made [14/07/2025, 10.55.59] Yousif Zaid: I’d rather learn how to use the silicon to make shit like in electrical but this is similar, just “one level down” [14/07/2025, 10.58.22] Yousif Zaid: Besides I can take electrical electives later. We are probably going to be just fine
[14/07/2025, 11.15.17] Ems : Yes you will
[14/07/2025, 11.15.24] Ems : You have backups and everything

[14/07/2025, 14.43.42] Yousif Zaid: It looks absolutely beautiful
[14/07/2025, 14.44.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[14/07/2025, 14.46.35] Yousif Zaid: I thought you were camping? Are you doing it outside the city or is that done now
[14/07/2025, 14.57.34] Ems : Yeah maybe hahahahaha
[14/07/2025, 14.57.42] Ems : No we are this is a daytrip

[14/07/2025, 17.59.13] Ems : You both look way younger
[14/07/2025, 17.59.26] Ems : Your hair is so long
[14/07/2025, 17.59.30] Yousif Zaid: Not sure what I was thinking with the hair

[14/07/2025, 19.29.21] Ems : video omitted
[14/07/2025, 19.41.05] Yousif Zaid: Was dragged out to this fun event where you pay 400 dkk and you get a canvas and oil paints and as many rum and cokes and mojitos as you can drink
[14/07/2025, 19.41.31] Yousif Zaid: Looks like a dream. Also looks like you plan on grilling gin
[14/07/2025, 20.25.02] Ems : That sounds so good do they still do it?
[14/07/2025, 20.25.11] Ems : We'll see
[14/07/2025, 20.25.13] Ems : Maybe
[14/07/2025, 22.42.04] Yousif Zaid: Let me check actually
[14/07/2025, 23.43.57] Yousif Zaid: Found it! Yes
[14/07/2025, 23.44.03] Yousif Zaid: The place is called Bien Contemporary
[14/07/2025, 23.45.04] Yousif Zaid: Portrait painting and cocktails,
Abstract painting and cocktails, that type of shit
[14/07/2025, 23.45.14] Yousif Zaid: 300 for the evening and one cocktail included
[15/07/2025, 08.24.46] Ems : Sounds really fun

[15/07/2025, 10.48.48] Yousif Zaid: This plate is not 3 litres I didn’t know it’s splashing boiling water everywhere
[15/07/2025, 11.00.05] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHHA
[15/07/2025, 11.00.11] Ems : Shit
[15/07/2025, 11.00.24] Yousif Zaid: It overflowed
[15/07/2025, 11.00.54] Yousif Zaid: When it started getting to the brim I started looking around for help like a lost dog
[15/07/2025, 11.01.50] Ems : It looks like it would only hold half of it
[15/07/2025, 11.01.50] Ems : Did you wait for it to cool down or did you go into panic mode?
[15/07/2025, 11.02.14] Yousif Zaid: What wait it kept gushing hot water for 10 minutes straight I do not know what I was thinking [15/07/2025, 11.03.42] Ems : This is so funny to me
[15/07/2025, 11.03.47] Ems : Like
[15/07/2025, 11.04.07] Yousif Zaid: Do you know how many times I said “ow”
[15/07/2025, 11.04.11] Ems : The machine just spilling while you look at it in a disappointed way
[15/07/2025, 11.04.38] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 11.04.38] Ems : 3 liters of boiling water
[15/07/2025, 11.04.42] Ems : Wow
[15/07/2025, 11.05.20] Yousif Zaid: Me watching it overflow onto my fingers
[15/07/2025, 11.05.21] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHA
[15/07/2025, 11.05.22] Ems : Dude it's 11 am

[15/07/2025, 11.05.41] Ems : You look like a beaten dog
[15/07/2025, 11.05.45] Ems : Also nice shirt
[15/07/2025, 11.06.16] Yousif Zaid: My appearance was so not the point of the image
[15/07/2025, 11.06.24] Yousif Zaid: “Haha here’s a photo of my disappointment”
[15/07/2025, 11.06.29] Yousif Zaid: “Man you look like shit”
[15/07/2025, 11.06.39] Yousif Zaid: Thank you ems

[15/07/2025, 11.08.01] Ems : It looks like you've seen shit
[15/07/2025, 11.08.02] Ems : There's a difference
[15/07/2025, 11.08.19] Ems : You look beaten down
[15/07/2025, 11.08.23] Yousif Zaid: A beaten dog!
[15/07/2025, 11.08.22] Ems : That was the point
[15/07/2025, 11.08.46] Ems : You drama queen with the exclamation points
[15/07/2025, 11.09.24] Yousif Zaid: I am working full time in the excel slave workshop and the weather is pretty and I might lose my license
[15/07/2025, 11.09.33] Yousif Zaid: I admit I am beaten down
[15/07/2025, 11.09.57] Yousif Zaid: You’re out here frolicking in Sorrento. I bet you look just fine
[15/07/2025, 11.12.14] Ems : My point was just that you looked sad not bad
[15/07/2025, 11.12.28] Ems : License? I'm sure that's going to be fine
[15/07/2025, 11.12.38] Yousif Zaid: I drove past the tunnel again and found a camera
[15/07/2025, 11.12.45] Yousif Zaid: But I didn’t speed at that point in the tunnel
[15/07/2025, 11.12.48] Yousif Zaid: I’m fine I think
[15/07/2025, 11.12.51] Ems : Yousif it's literally 40 degrees I look like shit
[15/07/2025, 11.13.01] Ems : I think it is
[15/07/2025, 11.13.40] Yousif Zaid: I have no response to this that won’t make me seem bitter about being the only person still in Denmark
[15/07/2025, 11.13.54] Yousif Zaid: Even my mom is gone. I’m gonna start asking to hang out with my neighbor I think
[15/07/2025, 11.14.06] Yousif Zaid: Good old John
[15/07/2025, 11.14.25] Ems : We're over here surviving on hot water, boiled by the sun
[15/07/2025, 11.14.26] Ems : Yes I like john
[15/07/2025, 11.14.59] Ems : I would tell you to come to Italy for a few days but I'm leaving for greece
[15/07/2025, 11.17.33] Yousif Zaid: Maybe it’s all the gorgeous countryside and city photos you’ve been sending me but I’m not convinced
[15/07/2025, 11.20.55] Yousif Zaid: I might book a ticket to Switzerland for a few days
[15/07/2025, 11.28.19] Ems : I'm sending the good parts, I'm not complaining it's really fun it just feels like desert heat
[15/07/2025, 11.28.50] Ems : See your cousin?
[15/07/2025, 11.28.51] Ems : You know when In American movies they put a yellow filter and little waves to show how hot it is? That's what this is
[15/07/2025, 11.29.37] Yousif Zaid: Maybe it’s my genes but I love that type of weather
[15/07/2025, 11.29.48] Yousif Zaid: Yeah, maybe. I’ll see how much it is
[15/07/2025, 11.40.40] Ems : Okok
[15/07/2025, 11.42.09] Ems : Also you know how I said I rented out my room? Indian guy has been there for two weeks now, I feel very invaded
[15/07/2025, 11.44.29] Yousif Zaid: Want me to pop by? Pretend like I still think you’re there
[15/07/2025, 11.44.36] Yousif Zaid: See what Indian activities he’s up to
[15/07/2025, 12.25.32] Ems : That's really nice of you but don't worry
[15/07/2025, 12.25.37] Ems : If there are any weird Indian activities I'd rather not know
[15/07/2025, 12.41.54] Yousif Zaid: I was joking what the fuck is an Indian activity
[15/07/2025, 12.43.20] Ems : Listen yousif
[15/07/2025, 12.43.21] Ems : The guy is in my personal space I don't know
[15/07/2025, 12.43.32] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAH
[15/07/2025, 12.45.29] Yousif Zaid: He’s in that bitch playing CRICKET
[15/07/2025, 12.46.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 12.49.45] Yousif Zaid: Just. Change the mattress
[15/07/2025, 12.50.02] Yousif Zaid: We dunk your mattress in bleach. Change the sheets. Don’t think about it too much
[15/07/2025, 13.02.53] Ems : Whole ass tournament
[15/07/2025, 13.03.03] Ems : I accept bleaching the mattress
[15/07/2025, 13.03.13] Ems : I obviously didn't leave him my sheets
[15/07/2025, 13.03.22] Ems : That grown man can get his own
[15/07/2025, 13.08.15] Yousif Zaid: Why do I feel some sense of hostility to this dude
[15/07/2025, 13.08.42] Yousif Zaid: You rented the place out to him it’s not like he’s a squatter
[15/07/2025, 13.21.41] Ems : No you're right
It's just when I actually left it felt like he was entering my space, which I actually invited him to
[15/07/2025, 13.22.05] Ems : I'm just being annoying about it
[15/07/2025, 13.23.20] Yousif Zaid: I would feel icky about it too don’t worry
[15/07/2025, 13.24.01] Yousif Zaid: We’re gonna find so many cricket balls laying around
[15/07/2025, 13.25.25] Yousif Zaid: The pigs at BDTU increased our rent by 200 dkk a month and they want another 400 dkk in deposits
[15/07/2025, 13.26.18] Yousif Zaid: Perhaps one of those red dots laying around
[15/07/2025, 13.26.24] Yousif Zaid: Actually is that a sticker
[15/07/2025, 13.57.22] Ems : It's going to be like an Easter egg hunt
[15/07/2025, 13.57.37] Ems : I know it's crazy
[15/07/2025, 13.57.42] Ems : I just saw
[15/07/2025, 13.57.46] Ems : ...
[15/07/2025, 13.57.51] Ems : I think so
[15/07/2025, 13.58.11] Yousif Zaid: They’d suit you
[15/07/2025, 13.58.27] Yousif Zaid: I have the biggest shit eating grin on my face right now
[15/07/2025, 13.59.16] Ems : You're just waiting for that third Indian to show up
[15/07/2025, 13.59.19] Ems : I can see it
[15/07/2025, 13.59.22] Ems : Fully
[15/07/2025, 13.59.40] Ems : You know three's a crowd
[15/07/2025, 14.04.49] Yousif Zaid: Three IS a crowd :)))
[15/07/2025, 14.05.05] Yousif Zaid: I think of it often
[15/07/2025, 14.10.30] Ems : The grin is still there I just know it

[15/07/2025, 14.22.57] Ems : [15/07/2025, 14.23.11] Ems : I'm climbing up a mountain in 39 degrees
[15/07/2025, 14.23.16] Ems : And this is the shit I get
[15/07/2025, 14.23.21] Yousif Zaid: My sides hurt
[15/07/2025, 14.23.29] Ems : image omitted
[15/07/2025, 14.23.54] Ems : Aw I'm sorry
[15/07/2025, 14.24.04] Yousif Zaid: You can’t just send me a picture like this right after the dot thing what were you expecting
[15/07/2025, 14.24.21] Yousif Zaid: My jaw hurts from laughing
[15/07/2025, 14.24.45] Ems : I really hope your coworkers see you and just wonder what the fuck
[15/07/2025, 14.25.13] Yousif Zaid: She has her back to me
[15/07/2025, 14.25.16] Yousif Zaid: I’m fine
[15/07/2025, 14.25.33] Yousif Zaid: My day has been made
[15/07/2025, 14.28.12] Ems : I'm glad this boosted your morale
[15/07/2025, 14.28.38] Ems : Just remember if I get the red dot I also get six beers
[15/07/2025, 14.29.33] Yousif Zaid: It would be worth buying you a pony
[15/07/2025, 14.30.27] Yousif Zaid: Calm down you don’t gotta marry one and get the red dot the deal was if a third one has any ideas
[15/07/2025, 14.31.52] Ems : I'd love one
[15/07/2025, 14.31.58] Ems : Thank god for that
[15/07/2025, 14.32.35] Yousif Zaid: If that’s how life turns out though it would be quite cathartic
[15/07/2025, 14.33.58] Ems : Not sure about that
[15/07/2025, 14.34.11] Ems : How tf would it be cathartic
[15/07/2025, 14.34.20] Ems : I'll give you ironic if anything
[15/07/2025, 14.34.38] Yousif Zaid: It would be cathartic for me, ironic for you
[15/07/2025, 14.35.06] Yousif Zaid: They’re fucking expensive I’m trying to find used secondhand ponies and it’s like 14.000 minimum
[15/07/2025, 14.57.35] Ems : Might be worth it I'll start saving up
[15/07/2025, 14.57.45] Ems : image omitted
[15/07/2025, 15.42.50] Yousif Zaid: Looks so nice. I’m laying on the couch doing some reading while my dad prepares to make us burgers
[15/07/2025, 15.49.16] Ems : Sounds amazing
[15/07/2025, 15.49.24] Ems : Finishing the brothers?
[15/07/2025, 16.03.41] Ems : image omitted
[15/07/2025, 16.03.46] Ems : I need your help
[15/07/2025, 16.04.17] Ems : My friend did this to the tire on the sidewalk and this is the damage, we have to drive back to Rome on the motorway tomorrow
[15/07/2025, 16.04.27] Ems : Do you think it's going to hold?
[15/07/2025, 16.04.44] Ems : The tire is still fully inflated btw and this happened at like 11 am
[15/07/2025, 16.07.14] Yousif Zaid: She’ll be right
[15/07/2025, 16.08.31] Yousif Zaid: The wheel in general looks a bit old so since it’s a bit chewed up now I’d like. Go out of your way to avoid potholes
[15/07/2025, 16.08.37] Yousif Zaid: And maybe drive the speed limit
[15/07/2025, 16.08.43] Yousif Zaid: Do I even have to ask ?
[15/07/2025, 16.24.38] Ems : It's not my car thankfully I'll tell her
[15/07/2025, 16.24.51] Ems : I only have to get back home
[15/07/2025, 16.25.01] Ems : ?
[15/07/2025, 16.26.01] Ems : Thank you
[15/07/2025, 16.35.30] Yousif Zaid: Oopsie?
[15/07/2025, 16.35.53] Yousif Zaid: Yeah I’d be surprised if the wheel randomly blew up unless you hit something
[15/07/2025, 16.36.37] Yousif Zaid: Wait what car is this
[15/07/2025, 16.36.45] Yousif Zaid: Also is it front wheel drive or rear wheel drive
[15/07/2025, 16.36.51] Yousif Zaid: And what wheel is this
[15/07/2025, 16.48.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 16.49.02] Yousif Zaid: Look the tyre is old, it’s a 3.5 hour car ride to Rome, the roads in Italy I’ve been told are bad.
[15/07/2025, 16.49.55] Yousif Zaid: Look the chances of the tyre blowing up are pretty low but I’m thinking about the consequences if it does, and it’s very dangerous. Do you have a spare tyre in the trunk?
[15/07/2025, 17.01.26] Ems : No oopsie was said
[15/07/2025, 17.01.36] Ems : Dacia
[15/07/2025, 17.01.42] Ems : Front right
[15/07/2025, 17.02.00] Yousif Zaid: A Dacia what. Basically I’m wondering if it’s a big heavy car or not
[15/07/2025, 17.02.03] Ems : We're going to be driving in the highway
[15/07/2025, 17.02.22] Ems : Dacia Sandero streetway
[15/07/2025, 17.02.32] Ems : It's an suv
[15/07/2025, 17.02.40] Ems : We do not
[15/07/2025, 17.03.03] Ems : If it's bad we can stop on the way to Naples at the Dacia shop
[15/07/2025, 17.03.27] Yousif Zaid: If it’s bad you’re gonna be stopping very rapidly in the middle of the highway
[15/07/2025, 17.04.11] Yousif Zaid: it’s a big car on old wheels on shit roads for 3.5 hours. Presumably filled with 19 year olds with their whole life ahead of them
[15/07/2025, 17.04.42] Yousif Zaid: I really don’t think there’s a high chance anything will go wrong, but I’m telling you that it’ll be an honest to god car crash if it does
[15/07/2025, 17.05.25] Ems : The car Is only 6 months old though
[15/07/2025, 17.06.07] Yousif Zaid: Like I’m saying, 99.9% chance it’ll be fine
[15/07/2025, 17.06.19] Yousif Zaid: But the 0.01% is the tyre blowing up randomly
[15/07/2025, 17.06.34] Ems : Ok I'll keep it in mind
[15/07/2025, 17.06.37] Ems : Cool
[15/07/2025, 17.06.46] Ems : Ok thank you so much
[15/07/2025, 17.07.30] Yousif Zaid: Drive the limit or maybe 5 under, it’ll probably be good
[15/07/2025, 17.07.35] Ems : I'll see if anything happens in the next few hours maybe and if not we call the mechanic. I think that's the best way to go about it
[15/07/2025, 17.07.56] Yousif Zaid: Why do the wheels look like that then
[15/07/2025, 17.08.36] Yousif Zaid: Whatever it’s fine. Tell your friend to get a spare tyre, and get an actual mechanic to check afterwards
[15/07/2025, 17.08.51] Yousif Zaid: Nothing will happen it’s fine it’s not leaking
[15/07/2025, 17.08.52] Ems : Her school is an hour from home
[15/07/2025, 17.09.12] Ems : Ok thanks Yousif
[15/07/2025, 17.09.31] Yousif Zaid: It’s just there’s a higher chance of the wheel blowing up if you drive it rough
[15/07/2025, 17.09.33] Yousif Zaid: That’s all
[15/07/2025, 17.09.42] Ems : Perfect
[15/07/2025, 17.09.55] Ems : Honestly I'd rather drive
[15/07/2025, 17.10.02] Ems : But I don't think that's happening
[15/07/2025, 17.10.19] Yousif Zaid: Your friend isn’t so talented at it?
[15/07/2025, 17.14.19] Ems : No she's actually really good it's only that I'm more sure if I do it
[15/07/2025, 17.15.00] Yousif Zaid: Yeah. The part that has me worried isn’t the odds but it’s what’ll happen if something goes wrong
[15/07/2025, 17.30.24] Ems : Same
[15/07/2025, 17.30.30] Ems : I'll hope for the best
[15/07/2025, 17.30.37] Yousif Zaid: God willing
[15/07/2025, 17.31.18] Ems : If something goes wrong you get my books
[15/07/2025, 19.42.45] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 19.46.01] Yousif Zaid: Top tip: do not eat 3 burgers and then go for a jog. It was not very fun
[15/07/2025, 20.34.14] Ems : It's funny because the Italian people criticise me because I only have English books
[15/07/2025, 20.34.28] Ems : This photo is definitely a meme now
[15/07/2025, 20.34.40] Ems : Why would you put yourself through that?
[15/07/2025, 20.35.37] Ems : Pro tip: iced tea gin and lemonade
[15/07/2025, 20.35.40] Yousif Zaid: i really thought i was good to go
[15/07/2025, 20.35.52] Yousif Zaid: jogged half my jog, felt my lunch coming up
[15/07/2025, 20.35.54] Yousif Zaid: instant stitches
[15/07/2025, 20.36.28] Yousif Zaid: that sounds delicious. i haven't had a pint in a month and i haven't had a smoke in 12 days. i'm losing it
[15/07/2025, 20.41.08] Ems : Uff I mean it makes sense after the burgers
[15/07/2025, 20.41.30] Ems : image omitted
[15/07/2025, 20.41.33] Ems : I'm living the life
[15/07/2025, 20.41.42] Ems : Are you ok now?
[15/07/2025, 20.41.48] Yousif Zaid: you're very good at both of these tasks
[15/07/2025, 20.41.55] Yousif Zaid: taking take of these folks. what are you playing them
[15/07/2025, 20.42.05] Yousif Zaid: shower and snus and i'm cruising
[15/07/2025, 20.42.56] Ems : video omitted
[15/07/2025, 20.43.05] Ems : Random songs that work
[15/07/2025, 20.43.09] Ems : Nice
[15/07/2025, 20.43.13] Ems : Grape flavoured?
[15/07/2025, 20.43.21] Yousif Zaid: those are long gone. we're back on mint
[15/07/2025, 20.43.28] Yousif Zaid: girls trip then?
[15/07/2025, 20.43.39] Yousif Zaid: wait do you take your sibling with you to friends things?
[15/07/2025, 20.43.48] Ems : No there's a few guys
[15/07/2025, 20.43.51] Ems : No...
[15/07/2025, 20.44.01] Ems : Like if Marta's there ok
[15/07/2025, 20.44.02] Yousif Zaid: i was gonna say i wouldnt take my brother to things
[15/07/2025, 20.44.17] Ems : Where did you see her?
[15/07/2025, 20.44.21] Ems : Like
[15/07/2025, 20.44.33] Ems : Does it seem like she's in the video
[15/07/2025, 20.44.36] Yousif Zaid: it was a 1 second long video i didn't see anybody i was just wondering
[15/07/2025, 20.46.05] Ems : I really like hanging out with Marta but I mostly don't bring her
[15/07/2025, 20.46.13] Ems : When she's there it's fine though
[15/07/2025, 20.46.23] Yousif Zaid: it's the same with my brother, we don't mix friend groups, i don't see his friends either
[15/07/2025, 20.50.09] Ems : Do you have a specific reason?
[15/07/2025, 20.51.06] Yousif Zaid: well i don't mind him hanging out with us from time to time but i don't massively enjoy hanging out with a group of 17 year old boys
[15/07/2025, 21.37.08] Ems : Fair honestly
[15/07/2025, 23.30.05] Yousif Zaid: new attempt at the name maker thingy
[15/07/2025, 23.30.11] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 23.31.32] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 23.31.56] Yousif Zaid: q is very far away from the rest, not many names have q
[15/07/2025, 23.36.23] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/07/2025, 23.38.35] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 06.32.59] Ems : If I actually understood this, I think I did, this is awesome
[16/07/2025, 06.33.11] Ems : The names are looking really good
[16/07/2025, 06.33.26] Ems : Aydelin is very pretty
[16/07/2025, 06.33.44] Ems : Can you explain this a little bit more?
[16/07/2025, 11.55.39] Yousif Zaid: Ignore the dotted lines. The three bottom oval ish rectangles represent “previous 3 letters” that are embedded onto a matrix containing embedding vectors as columns
[16/07/2025, 11.56.55] Yousif Zaid: Those 3 all point to a hidden layer, all of it is y=mx+b but vector form so it’s just a matrix multiplication. This is fed into a TanH to make it learn nonlinear patterns, then this output is matrix multiplied in the same way as before with a layer that outputs probabilities for the 4th letter
[16/07/2025, 11.57.51] Yousif Zaid: In the end it just becomes a math expression that we can chain rule and gradient method, except there’s 12 thousand variables
[16/07/2025, 11.58.26] Yousif Zaid: We find the values for the 12 thousand variables that give us the lowest loss
[16/07/2025, 12.00.12] Yousif Zaid: It’s really just 5 matrix multiplications that we repeat over and over again on big matrices and we do the optimisation stuff from math 1b, the little details are mostly for convenience or speed [16/07/2025, 12.10.27] Yousif Zaid: I followed a research paper from 2003 that came out of Quebec so we’re a long ways from modern AI still, but hopefully I get there
[16/07/2025, 13.24.10] Ems : So so cool
[16/07/2025, 13.24.35] Ems : It's actually amazing you did that
[16/07/2025, 13.25.15] Yousif Zaid: I have to be bashful again but please stop
[16/07/2025, 13.29.35] Ems : Hahahahahahah
[16/07/2025, 13.29.45] Ems : It's really good work
[16/07/2025, 13.29.52] Yousif Zaid: Like seriously I hid my face when the notif popped up
[16/07/2025, 13.30.40] Ems : Don't tell me you blushed
[16/07/2025, 13.31.12] Yousif Zaid: Not sure I don’t have a mirror
[16/07/2025, 13.31.31] Yousif Zaid: You like ballet?
[16/07/2025, 13.33.34] Ems : Yes I that was one of my sports
[16/07/2025, 13.33.37] Ems : I did it for 8 years
[16/07/2025, 13.33.45] Yousif Zaid: I mean to view
[16/07/2025, 13.34.09] Ems : It's funny to imagine
[16/07/2025, 13.34.10] Ems : Also yes
[16/07/2025, 13.34.10] Ems : Why?
[16/07/2025, 13.34.35] Yousif Zaid: Want to see the nutcracker with me this November?
[16/07/2025, 13.34.54] Ems : Absolutely yes
[16/07/2025, 13.35.24] Yousif Zaid: I’m telling you right now I will start crying when the Pas de Deux dance comes on
[16/07/2025, 13.35.38] Ems : I'll tell you a fun fact, nutcracker was one of the rehearsals I did when I was like 5
[16/07/2025, 13.35.50] Yousif Zaid: That’s so adorable
[16/07/2025, 13.37.18] Ems : Ballet is so emotional
[16/07/2025, 13.37.24] Ems : In general
[16/07/2025, 13.37.27] Ems : But that sounds amazing
[16/07/2025, 13.37.31] Ems : Where is it in Copenhagen?
[16/07/2025, 13.37.38] Yousif Zaid: The royal theatre
[16/07/2025, 13.37.46] Yousif Zaid: In kongens nytorv
[16/07/2025, 13.38.17] Yousif Zaid: Do people dress up to go there? Whenever I go to see the philharmonic I always wear a suit and I’m utterly overdressed but the royal theatre seems like the place
[16/07/2025, 13.39.04] Ems : I Just searched it it's absolutely beautiful
[16/07/2025, 13.39.14] Ems : Yes you have to dress up for ballet
[16/07/2025, 13.39.19] Ems : It's also really fun to
[16/07/2025, 13.39.22] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 13.39.32] Ems : Oh yes
[16/07/2025, 13.39.34] Yousif Zaid: Great, I love dressing up
[16/07/2025, 13.39.50] Ems : Whenever I went to the opera I dressed up, I'm guessing this is the same
[16/07/2025, 13.40.05] Yousif Zaid: I went to the Phil with a friend from high school and I was like “we have to dress up!!” And I wore a 3 piece suit and she wore a gala dress and heels
[16/07/2025, 13.40.13] Yousif Zaid: We show up and everybody is in t shirts
[16/07/2025, 13.40.18] Yousif Zaid: She was mad at me ahahhahahaha
[16/07/2025, 13.40.40] Yousif Zaid: The tickets aren’t even so expensive since we’re below 25
[16/07/2025, 13.41.00] Ems : Hahahahahahahahha
[16/07/2025, 13.41.12] Ems : I can imagine, but honestly it's just funny
[16/07/2025, 13.41.19] Ems : It's only awkward if you care
[16/07/2025, 13.41.34] Yousif Zaid: She had like 4 old men approach her like “you look very nice young lady”
[16/07/2025, 13.41.41] Ems : We're still 17 for a few kont6
[16/07/2025, 13.41.46] Ems : Months*
[16/07/2025, 13.42.05] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t mind at all it was just inconvenient for her to walk around in stilettos
[16/07/2025, 13.42.16] Ems : Aww that sounds either very cute or awkward
[16/07/2025, 13.42.19] Yousif Zaid: That’s right! I forgot
[16/07/2025, 13.42.39] Ems : I agree with her now
[16/07/2025, 13.42.43] Yousif Zaid: It was more cute
[16/07/2025, 13.43.14] Yousif Zaid: I hadn’t been to the Phil before idk. The musicians dress up so I thought I’d extend the same courtesy. They probably didn’t notice my very nice suit from the cheap ass seat I was sitting in [16/07/2025, 13.45.35] Ems : You were best dressed so it's a win
[16/07/2025, 13.45.44] Ems : Have you ever been to the ballet?
[16/07/2025, 13.46.18] Yousif Zaid: I have not. Sean lake is also premiering soon but I have to check if it’s still on when you’re back
[16/07/2025, 13.46.44] Yousif Zaid: Do you have a preference ?
[16/07/2025, 13.48.25] Ems : I've seen the nutcracker once when I was 10 but never swan lake
Nutcracker is more Christmasy for November though so I don't really mind
[16/07/2025, 13.48.29] Ems : Do you?
[16/07/2025, 13.50.24] Yousif Zaid: I don’t but swan lake runs til October
[16/07/2025, 13.50.54] Yousif Zaid: So we can choose between them, or both? Not sure
[16/07/2025, 13.51.37] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 13.51.52] Yousif Zaid: Corner balcony seats seem to have an okay view and cost 140 dkk cuz we’re 17
[16/07/2025, 13.53.28] Ems : That's really good
[16/07/2025, 13.53.37] Ems : Shame we turn 18 in December
[16/07/2025, 13.54.00] Yousif Zaid: So upsetting, I’m being kicked out of all the youth clubs I’m a part of
[16/07/2025, 13.54.13] Yousif Zaid: Funny story one time me and the boys wanted to play pool and we find a place and go in
[16/07/2025, 13.54.22] Yousif Zaid: Only the building seems to be full of 13 year olds?
[16/07/2025, 13.54.52] Yousif Zaid: After 15 minutes an adult man approaches us and in a nice way asks us “what the fuck are you 21 year olds doing here”
[16/07/2025, 13.55.09] Yousif Zaid: Turns out it was an after school care program for CHILDREN that we just trespassed into
[16/07/2025, 13.57.04] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAH
[16/07/2025, 13.57.19] Ems : You poor guys just wanted to play some pool
[16/07/2025, 13.57.25] Yousif Zaid: And I looked up and shit and I was like
[16/07/2025, 13.57.35] Yousif Zaid: “Now that he says it, there’s literally only kids here”
[16/07/2025, 13.57.42] Yousif Zaid: They had a PlayStation and shit
[16/07/2025, 13.57.46] Yousif Zaid: He was cooking them dinner
[16/07/2025, 13.58.23] Ems : Did he invite you to join?
[16/07/2025, 13.58.33] Yousif Zaid: Fuck no he wanted my hairy ass gone
[16/07/2025, 13.58.46] Ems : Hahahahahahhaha
[16/07/2025, 13.58.58] Yousif Zaid: Like we have facial hair and shit [16/07/2025, 13.59.13] Ems : I think you're also overestimating the age of the kids
[16/07/2025, 13.59.20] Ems : They were probably younger
[16/07/2025, 13.59.45] Yousif Zaid: You only want to make this worse for me
[16/07/2025, 13.59.49] Ems : You were playing against a bunch of elementary school kids
[16/07/2025, 13.59.53] Ems : Yes
[16/07/2025, 14.00.02] Yousif Zaid: They weren’t playing with us
[16/07/2025, 14.00.09] Ems : Still
[16/07/2025, 14.00.19] Yousif Zaid: They weren’t tall enough to reach over the table [16/07/2025, 14.00.32] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA
[16/07/2025, 14.00.43] Ems : They were cooking them dinner
[16/07/2025, 14.00.46] Ems : Help
[16/07/2025, 14.00.57] Yousif Zaid: I felt like such a loser I can’t lie to you
[16/07/2025, 14.01.08] Yousif Zaid: I was even like “then it’s pretty weird that we’re here then, huh” to the guy
[16/07/2025, 14.01.15] Yousif Zaid: And he nodded his head and went “yep”
[16/07/2025, 14.01.55] Ems : I can imagine the little kids laughing every time they remember you guys
[16/07/2025, 14.02.21] Yousif Zaid: I asked the guy if we could finish our game and he made a face and said “yeah okay just don’t come back”
[16/07/2025, 14.02.27] Yousif Zaid: Felt like a pedophile
[16/07/2025, 14.05.06] Ems : Yep that tracks
[16/07/2025, 14.05.33] Yousif Zaid: My friend who suggested the place was like “I’ve been coming here for months”
[16/07/2025, 14.06.55] Ems : Is he generally a clueless person?
[16/07/2025, 14.07.20] Yousif Zaid: I would honestly say he’s quite sharp
[16/07/2025, 14.07.31] Yousif Zaid: But the way he speaks “sounds” clueless if that makes sense
[16/07/2025, 14.07.40] Ems : Then I would get worried
[16/07/2025, 14.07.43] Ems : It does
[16/07/2025, 14.07.51] Ems : I can think of a few people
[16/07/2025, 14.07.58] Ems : Like that
[16/07/2025, 14.13.40] Ems : We just entered the highway start praying
[16/07/2025, 14.14.10] Yousif Zaid: Unironically text me when you get there
[16/07/2025, 14.14.16] Yousif Zaid: Also yes I’ll do a little prayer
[16/07/2025, 14.14.41] Ems : I will
[16/07/2025, 14.14.59] Ems : Listen to the song they're playing I'm getting worried
[16/07/2025, 14.15.07] Ems : audio omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.15.23] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
[16/07/2025, 14.15.28] Ems : I'm dying over here
[16/07/2025, 14.15.31] Yousif Zaid: That might be the worst thing I’ve
[16/07/2025, 14.15.34] Yousif Zaid: Wow
[16/07/2025, 14.15.45] Yousif Zaid: I’ve changed my mind it’s amazing
[16/07/2025, 14.15.48] Ems : Istg it's terrible
[16/07/2025, 14.15.52] Ems : In dying laughing
[16/07/2025, 14.15.59] Yousif Zaid: Please send me more
[16/07/2025, 14.16.07] Ems : Not if it's the last song I ever listen to
[16/07/2025, 14.16.23] Ems : audio omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.17.01] Ems : This is so funny for no reason
[16/07/2025, 14.17.18] Ems : If I die with this it's really embarrassing
[16/07/2025, 14.17.34] Ems : audio omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.17.48] Yousif Zaid: I actually fuck with this
[16/07/2025, 14.17.54] Yousif Zaid: It’s the new Travis Scott isn’t it
[16/07/2025, 14.18.04] Ems : Yes
[16/07/2025, 14.18.10] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.18.09] Ems : I think I hate it
[16/07/2025, 14.18.18] Ems : Yup
[16/07/2025, 14.18.22] Ems : That's the album
[16/07/2025, 14.18.47] Yousif Zaid: Look I listen to carti it’s like
[16/07/2025, 14.18.55] Yousif Zaid: I don’t mind music that sounds ridiculous
[16/07/2025, 14.19.33] Ems : I like rap and some trap
[16/07/2025, 14.19.38] Ems : This is just horrible
[16/07/2025, 14.19.41] Ems : I'm sorry
[16/07/2025, 14.19.47] Ems : I stand by what I said
[16/07/2025, 14.19.53] Yousif Zaid: No I get it
[16/07/2025, 14.19.56] Yousif Zaid: It’s not for everybody
[16/07/2025, 14.20.03] Yousif Zaid: It takes a lot for me to say a song is bad
[16/07/2025, 14.20.21] Ems : For me too usually
[16/07/2025, 14.20.26] Ems : This ticks the box
[16/07/2025, 14.20.40] Yousif Zaid: What the fuck is the wobbily wiggly shit
[16/07/2025, 14.20.41] Yousif Zaid: I’m crying
[16/07/2025, 14.21.13] Ems : HAHAHHAHAHAHA
[16/07/2025, 14.21.16] Ems : I KNOW
[16/07/2025, 14.21.48] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes I’m horrified at what pops up on our blend
[16/07/2025, 14.22.21] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.22.26] Yousif Zaid: One of these does not belong
[16/07/2025, 14.23.18] Ems : Yeah it adds random stuff sometimes
[16/07/2025, 14.23.27] Ems : It's generally a really good playlist though
[16/07/2025, 14.23.38] Yousif Zaid: I do listen to crank but it just does not match the rest
[16/07/2025, 14.23.57] Yousif Zaid: It’s basically just a guy having an aneurism over a beat
[16/07/2025, 14.24.17] Ems : image omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.24.29] Ems : I'm just saying
[16/07/2025, 14.24.37] Yousif Zaid: I do. I admit it
[16/07/2025, 14.25.38] Ems : Once you know all the lyrics it'll be even more fun to sing in the car
[16/07/2025, 14.25.48] Yousif Zaid: I pretty much do
[16/07/2025, 14.26.35] Ems : Ok good
[16/07/2025, 14.27.26] Yousif Zaid: I also know the words to “how to disappear” now but I’ll let you do that one solo
[16/07/2025, 14.28.59] Ems : We can do a duet
[16/07/2025, 14.29.36] Yousif Zaid: Nah I like hearing you sing it, you sound exactly like the recording
[16/07/2025, 14.30.09] Ems : Now I'm being bashful
[16/07/2025, 14.30.21] Ems : Saying I should like Lana is a really big compliment
[16/07/2025, 14.30.36] Yousif Zaid: I’m serious you sound great
[16/07/2025, 14.30.45] Yousif Zaid: It’s the only song I won’t sing with you, that’s all you
[16/07/2025, 14.34.11] Ems : Ok but now you have to pick a song to sing next time
[16/07/2025, 14.34.43] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna belt out the entirety of “the zone” and you’ll never ask me to do this again but sure
[16/07/2025, 14.35.26] Ems : Ok let's do that
[16/07/2025, 14.36.12] Ems : I'll request it when you come to italy
[16/07/2025, 14.36.21] Ems : Ok the music here improved
[16/07/2025, 14.36.26] Yousif Zaid: I’m not singing that infront of your sister
[16/07/2025, 14.36.33] Yousif Zaid: Or Claudio
[16/07/2025, 14.36.32] Ems : audio omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.36.52] Ems : Marta does NOT judge
[16/07/2025, 14.36.59] Ems : I get that one
[16/07/2025, 14.37.13] Yousif Zaid: Emma the song is uh, suggestive it’s not happening
[16/07/2025, 14.37.20] Yousif Zaid: Rather Claudio than your sister
[16/07/2025, 14.38.05] Ems : Ok fine whatever
[16/07/2025, 14.38.12] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAH
[16/07/2025, 14.38.13] Ems : Ok
[16/07/2025, 14.38.22] Ems : Definitely not my grandma?
[16/07/2025, 14.38.27] Yousif Zaid: I could pick a different song
[16/07/2025, 14.39.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 14.39.50] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
[16/07/2025, 14.39.57] Ems : I'm laughing my ass off thinking about Claudio my sister and my grandma seeing you sing this
[16/07/2025, 14.40.24] Yousif Zaid: I make eye contact with Claudio while singing this he’s running through your wall to escape
[16/07/2025, 14.40.41] Yousif Zaid: That actually sounds like an anxiety dream I would have
[16/07/2025, 14.41.47] Ems : Bugs bunny style
[16/07/2025, 14.41.57] Yousif Zaid: What I’m saying
[16/07/2025, 14.46.13] Yousif Zaid: Also when did this become a humiliation ritual I never said anything about doing it infront of others
[16/07/2025, 14.47.35] Ems : I'm sorry but I just said Italy and you assumed it was in front of other people
[16/07/2025, 14.47.45] Ems : That was you self sabotaging
[16/07/2025, 14.48.18] Yousif Zaid: You’re right. Somehow when I think Italy I always imagine Claudio and ur sister there at all times
[16/07/2025, 21.14.43] Yousif Zaid: Tire blew up?
[16/07/2025, 22.15.40] Ems : I am in fact alive and well
[16/07/2025, 22.16.35] Ems : What are you up to?
[16/07/2025, 22.22.33] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 22.22.48] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/07/2025, 22.57.26] Ems : Who won?? Or was it friendly
[16/07/2025, 22.57.38] Ems : Say hi to dimi from me!!
[16/07/2025, 23.42.48] Yousif Zaid: It was friendly and I would be so bold as to say I did
[16/07/2025, 23.42.53] Yousif Zaid: Fuck I left already
[17/07/2025, 00.18.38] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[17/07/2025, 00.18.53] Yousif Zaid: We didn’t record the entire thing but I got him good a couple times like this
[17/07/2025, 06.46.39] Ems : WELL DONE
[17/07/2025, 09.47.42] Yousif Zaid: Thank you thank you
[17/07/2025, 09.48.04] Yousif Zaid: What about you? What’d you get up to after getting home
[17/07/2025, 10.29.51] Yousif Zaid: Pleased to report that the national university of Singapore has everything I need also
[17/07/2025, 11.41.46] Ems : Marta came back from her travels so we stayed up chatting for a few hours
[17/07/2025, 11.41.50] Ems : GOOD
[17/07/2025, 11.41.55] Ems : I'll check for mine
[17/07/2025, 11.42.04] Ems : But honestly mine should be nearly anywhere
[17/07/2025, 11.43.28] Yousif Zaid: That’s cute. My brother likes to do the same but he can’t stand just being normal so what he does is force himself into my room and wrestle me and refuse to leave so I’m just forced to speak to him til 3 AM even though I have work at 8 AM [17/07/2025, 11.44.38] Yousif Zaid: What do you have?
[17/07/2025, 11.49.24] Ems : That's still adorable
[17/07/2025, 12.13.42] Ems : image omitted
[17/07/2025, 12.13.58] Yousif Zaid: Seems easy enough
[17/07/2025, 12.14.14] Ems : Exactly
[17/07/2025, 12.14.21] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/07/2025, 12.14.26] Ems : So you have two options for now?
[17/07/2025, 12.14.35] Ems : Fuck yes
[17/07/2025, 12.14.44] Ems : Wait why in your old office?
[17/07/2025, 12.14.48] Yousif Zaid: Yes but I’m inclined to lean towards NUS, I didn’t know it was such an elite school
[17/07/2025, 12.14.54] Yousif Zaid: There’s a couch ahahahahha
[17/07/2025, 12.15.15] Ems : Yeah it looks like your old office
[17/07/2025, 12.15.24] Ems : That's Singapore right?
[17/07/2025, 12.15.32] Yousif Zaid: Yes, national university of Singapore
[17/07/2025, 12.15.38] Ems : I know I've been on that couch
[17/07/2025, 12.15.41] Yousif Zaid: Top 10 global universities
[17/07/2025, 12.15.59] Yousif Zaid: It’s better than Cornell, I’ll look into Hong Kong and stuff
[17/07/2025, 12.16.11] Ems : That was around 9.5 Gpa right?
[17/07/2025, 12.16.21] Yousif Zaid: Yes ma’am
[17/07/2025, 12.16.26] Ems : Ok good
[17/07/2025, 12.16.34] Ems : I got this
[17/07/2025, 12.16.37] Yousif Zaid: What language do they speak there
[17/07/2025, 12.16.55] Yousif Zaid: Can we learn Malay
[17/07/2025, 12.16.57] Ems : image omitted
[17/07/2025, 12.17.04] Ems : English is one of them
[17/07/2025, 12.17.07] Ems : Yes
[17/07/2025, 12.17.28] Ems : Are you sure we shouldn't learn Japanese?
[17/07/2025, 12.17.32] Yousif Zaid: “Because of its bilingual education policy” dude I fucking love Singapore for this
[17/07/2025, 12.18.01] Yousif Zaid: We could! If I had to choose between Singapore or Japan I think I’d do Singapore tho
[17/07/2025, 12.18.50] Ems : Exactly the opposite of the usa
[17/07/2025, 12.18.53] Ems : Thank god
[17/07/2025, 12.19.09] Ems : Same, it would just be really funny to learn Japanese
[17/07/2025, 12.19.27] Yousif Zaid: Westerners are obsessed with Japan it would be a cliche
[17/07/2025, 12.19.31] Yousif Zaid: Which is probably why it’s funny
[17/07/2025, 12.19.49] Yousif Zaid: It would be cool if we ended up in the same place
[17/07/2025, 12.20.23] Ems : It really would
[17/07/2025, 12.20.44] Ems : Yes, like we go to get sushi and I start ordering in Japanese
[17/07/2025, 12.20.46] Ems : Imagine
[17/07/2025, 12.20.57] Yousif Zaid: The Spanish waitress just stares at you
[17/07/2025, 12.22.19] Ems : I would learn the language just to confuse the very danish girl that's bringing the food
[17/07/2025, 12.22.45] Yousif Zaid: It’s just as absurd to order in Malay at that point
[17/07/2025, 12.39.27] Ems : True
[17/07/2025, 12.39.31] Ems : Might do that
[17/07/2025, 12.40.11] Yousif Zaid: You reckon we should get the ballet tickets soon? There are very few left
[17/07/2025, 12.45.00] Ems : Yes how much are the student ones?
[17/07/2025, 12.45.22] Yousif Zaid: Depends on the seat, the cheapest seats I could find were 140
[17/07/2025, 12.45.38] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/07/2025, 12.52.05] Ems : Ok perfect
[17/07/2025, 12.52.24] Yousif Zaid: Swan lake or nutcracker or both?
[17/07/2025, 12.52.40] Ems : Mmmm
[17/07/2025, 12.53.03] Ems : I don't know what do you think?
[17/07/2025, 12.53.20] Ems : Definitely nutcracker because Christmas
[17/07/2025, 12.53.28] Ems : I think
[17/07/2025, 12.53.34] Ems : What's your preference?
[17/07/2025, 12.53.55] Yousif Zaid: The tickets are cheap. I definitely want to see the nutcracker but I would also be interested in seeing swan lake also
[17/07/2025, 12.54.17] Yousif Zaid: If you want to do both I’m down, if it has to be one, let it be nutcracker
[17/07/2025, 13.14.30] Ems : Yes let's do it
[17/07/2025, 13.14.59] Yousif Zaid: Any seat preferences or can I do whatever
[17/07/2025, 13.17.38] Ems : I trust your choice
[17/07/2025, 13.48.32] Yousif Zaid: Tickets have been bought. I’m actually really excited
[17/07/2025, 13.54.15] Yousif Zaid: Our seats for swan lake are pretty good, less so for the nutcracker but Sebastian assures me it’ll be a nice time anyhow
[17/07/2025, 14.55.33] Ems : Same here!
[17/07/2025, 14.55.39] Ems : I'm sure it will
[17/07/2025, 14.55.44] Ems : Let me know how much
[17/07/2025, 14.55.51] Yousif Zaid: I forgot
[17/07/2025, 14.58.15] Ems : You liar
[17/07/2025, 14.58.20] Ems : Come on
[17/07/2025, 14.58.49] Yousif Zaid: I fell down the stairs and hit my head
[17/07/2025, 15.05.43] Ems : Watch out I'll randomly revolut you 600 kr
[17/07/2025, 15.05.57] Yousif Zaid: Still don’t have revolut
[17/07/2025, 15.06.07] Yousif Zaid: Look we’re probably gonna end up getting dinner before the show or whatever
[17/07/2025, 15.06.16] Yousif Zaid: Buy me a burger and perhaps a coke and we’re even
[17/07/2025, 15.07.53] Ems : Fine
[17/07/2025, 15.07.58] Ems : You're getting fries as well
[17/07/2025, 15.08.05] Ems : And a beer
[17/07/2025, 15.08.25] Yousif Zaid: 3 fries and a sip final offer
[17/07/2025, 15.08.36] Ems : No.
[17/07/2025, 15.08.43] Ems : You're getting both final offer
[17/07/2025, 15.08.48] Yousif Zaid: 6 fries and a gulp
[17/07/2025, 15.09.16] Ems : I stand by this
[17/07/2025, 15.09.26] Ems : You're drinking the pint idc
[17/07/2025, 15.09.30] Yousif Zaid: This reminds me of the time I took a friend of mine to an Arabic restaurant
[17/07/2025, 15.10.33] Yousif Zaid: She’s this tiny tiny woman. Like 150 cm tall. She insists that she doesnt eat much and that we can share a plate of food, despite me telling her it’ll embarrass me. So I go up to the Arabic cashier with her and order 1 plate of food
[17/07/2025, 15.11.07] Yousif Zaid: And he looks at me, then her, and in Arabic says “times are tough? There’s two of you” and I have never been so mortified in my life
[17/07/2025, 15.39.29] Ems : Hahahahahahhaha
[17/07/2025, 15.39.39] Ems : This is exactly the opposite
[17/07/2025, 15.39.51] Ems : I'm telling you you're not only getting a coke
[17/07/2025, 15.39.57] Yousif Zaid: I know this just reminded me
[17/07/2025, 15.40.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/07/2025, 15.40.33] Ems : Awww he looks so happy with it

[17/07/2025, 15.42.37] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHA he really took your word about getting your stuff
[17/07/2025, 15.42.57] Ems : You're not yourself without your aygo
[17/07/2025, 15.43.03] Yousif Zaid: No I am not
[17/07/2025, 15.43.04] Ems : Don't get lost
[17/07/2025, 15.43.13] Yousif Zaid: I know how to walk
[17/07/2025, 15.43.20] Ems : I'm not sure
[17/07/2025, 15.43.30] Ems : Also cool shirt
[17/07/2025, 15.43.41] Ems : From what I see

[17/07/2025, 15.50.42] Ems : Your poses are getting better by the day
[17/07/2025, 15.51.01] Yousif Zaid: Thank you thank you
[17/07/2025, 15.51.05] Yousif Zaid: I think tucked in is the move
[17/07/2025, 15.51.06] Ems : I'm going to Greece today
[17/07/2025, 15.51.07] Ems : I'm leaving in half an hour
[17/07/2025, 15.51.20] Yousif Zaid: I hope you’re packed
[17/07/2025, 16.35.48] Ems : video omitted
[17/07/2025, 16.42.16] Yousif Zaid: Very nice. Is that the new shirt?
[17/07/2025, 17.08.27] Ems : Yes
[17/07/2025, 17.08.30] Ems : Good eye
[17/07/2025, 22.26.44] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/07/2025, 22.26.44] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/07/2025, 23.55.18] Ems : Where did you go?
[17/07/2025, 23.55.32] Ems : Very beautiful
[17/07/2025, 23.55.36] Yousif Zaid: I waltzed into a retirement home
[17/07/2025, 23.55.50] Yousif Zaid: They have birds there to keep them happy
[17/07/2025, 23.56.15] Ems : Adorable
[17/07/2025, 23.56.19] Ems : Just randomly?
[17/07/2025, 23.56.24] Yousif Zaid: It was very funny me and Louis walked in
[17/07/2025, 23.56.32] Yousif Zaid: Old guy in a wheelchair starts shaking his head at us
[17/07/2025, 23.56.45] Yousif Zaid: Louis says “we’re not allowed here?”
[17/07/2025, 23.56.51] Yousif Zaid: He keeps shaking his head
[17/07/2025, 23.57.21] Yousif Zaid: I look down and see a sign that says “all are welcome” and I tell Louis “I think he just has tremors man” and we go look at the birds
[17/07/2025, 23.58.05] Yousif Zaid: The boys met up for dinner at “The Turning Chicken” but we walked around the neighborhood before and after
[17/07/2025, 23.59.36] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[17/07/2025, 23.59.47] Ems : The poor guy was just sitting
[17/07/2025, 23.59.57] Ems : That sounds lovely
[18/07/2025, 00.00.04] Yousif Zaid: In Louie’s defense his tremors looked exactly like a “no” head shake
[18/07/2025, 00.00.14] Ems : I'm in Athens at the moment
[18/07/2025, 00.00.30] Ems : Yeah fair
[18/07/2025, 00.00.33] Yousif Zaid: Yes that’s right! How long will you be staying? I have somebody in Athens I need you to assault
[18/07/2025, 00.00.54] Yousif Zaid: Bring Marta and perhaps your dad also, this guy really needs to be battered
[18/07/2025, 00.08.43] Ems : We're leaving tomorrow for Lefkada
[18/07/2025, 00.08.50] Ems : Give me name and address
[18/07/2025, 00.08.55] Ems : I'll take care of it
[18/07/2025, 00.09.06] Yousif Zaid: Dmitri Atryos
[18/07/2025, 00.09.10] Yousif Zaid: Nickname “Jim”
[18/07/2025, 00.09.18] Yousif Zaid: Lives in the neighborhood of Nikaia
[18/07/2025, 00.09.47] Yousif Zaid: That’s all I know
[18/07/2025, 00.09.53] Yousif Zaid: Make it so he can’t walk anymore
[18/07/2025, 00.09.58] Ems : Done
[18/07/2025, 00.10.01] Ems : What did he do?
[18/07/2025, 00.10.08] Yousif Zaid: Waste his life
[18/07/2025, 00.12.55] Yousif Zaid: So we must take it from him unfortunately
[18/07/2025, 00.13.38] Ems : This seems very personal
[18/07/2025, 00.13.48] Yousif Zaid: It is
[18/07/2025, 00.14.15] Ems : I feel like you maybe told me something about this before
[18/07/2025, 00.14.30] Yousif Zaid: He’s actually a good friend of mine it’s just a bit we have together
[18/07/2025, 00.14.49] Yousif Zaid: You know how you sometimes say I should show you a thing or two about the nerd shit programming I do?
[18/07/2025, 00.15.10] Yousif Zaid: I coached him from beginning to a pretty decent level and he went to BUSINESS SCHOOL instead
[18/07/2025, 00.15.25] Yousif Zaid: He’s gotta go. Leave him in a wheelchair
[18/07/2025, 00.16.00] Ems : Which I would really appreciate
[18/07/2025, 00.16.05] Ems : Ok done
[18/07/2025, 00.16.24] Yousif Zaid: I’m talking like. Literally dozens of hours of tutoring over the Covid pandemic
[18/07/2025, 00.16.26] Ems : Get the wheelchair ready soon
[18/07/2025, 00.16.33] Yousif Zaid: I wanted us to make an app together or something
[18/07/2025, 00.16.51] Yousif Zaid: But he goes to the university of west Attica to study business administration instead
[18/07/2025, 00.16.54] Yousif Zaid: Sick to my stomach
[18/07/2025, 00.17.08] Ems : Is he doing well?
[18/07/2025, 00.17.14] Yousif Zaid: No
[18/07/2025, 00.17.21] Ems : Oh
[18/07/2025, 00.17.23] Ems : Oops
[18/07/2025, 00.17.31] Yousif Zaid: He says it’s a dogshit programme he just reads pdfs and PowerPoint slides
[18/07/2025, 00.17.35] Yousif Zaid: That’s the whole education
[18/07/2025, 00.18.03] Yousif Zaid: I helped him cheat on his virtual math exam (business math 101, think of like, power rule in calculus was the hardest thing)
[18/07/2025, 00.18.08] Yousif Zaid: He still failed
[18/07/2025, 00.18.26] Yousif Zaid: You’re the one over there the wheelchair is not my responsibility
[18/07/2025, 00.18.26] Ems : Oh no
[18/07/2025, 00.18.38] Ems : That sucks actually
[18/07/2025, 00.18.48] Yousif Zaid: Yeah. He had so much potential
[18/07/2025, 00.19.07] Yousif Zaid: Actually I wish I had the foresight to give you a present to give to him
[18/07/2025, 00.19.07] Ems : It kind of is but whatever
[18/07/2025, 00.19.39] Yousif Zaid: I did the same for a friend of mine in Lithuania. My other friend travelled there and I gave her a snow globe and a letter to give to him
[18/07/2025, 00.19.52] Yousif Zaid: I’m stupid I should have done the same for poor Jim
[18/07/2025, 00.20.37] Ems : That would've been thinking way too ahead
[18/07/2025, 00.20.57] Ems : I'm kind of tired so I'm going to get some sleep
[18/07/2025, 00.21.01] Ems : Goodnight
[18/07/2025, 00.21.14] Yousif Zaid: Sleep tight
[18/07/2025, 09.38.22] Yousif Zaid: You ever learn a random fact about your parents life from before you were born?
[18/07/2025, 10.21.55] Ems : Yes it usually changes my whole perspective on life
[18/07/2025, 10.21.57] Ems : What happened?
[18/07/2025, 10.22.39] Yousif Zaid: My father and aunt started ballet from age 8 and he was a professional ballet dancer until he was 28
[18/07/2025, 10.23.15] Yousif Zaid: He travelled with his company and performed at places like the Hofberg Palace in Vienna
[18/07/2025, 10.24.04] Yousif Zaid: My aunt was the swan or whatever in swan lake
[18/07/2025, 10.24.14] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[18/07/2025, 10.26.34] Yousif Zaid: Now he’s literally never mentioned this. He said he “used to do ballet as a kid”
[18/07/2025, 10.39.45] Ems : No way you're making this up
[18/07/2025, 10.39.54] Ems : How on earth did this never come up
[18/07/2025, 10.40.02] Ems : So so impressive
[18/07/2025, 10.40.08] Yousif Zaid: ?????
[18/07/2025, 10.40.42] Ems : He didn't lie, it's so weird that he never elaborated on it
[18/07/2025, 10.41.00] Yousif Zaid: If I had done that I would literally never shut up about it
[18/07/2025, 10.41.47] Ems : This is so mysterious and cool of him
[18/07/2025, 10.42.09] Ems : No we're on the highway and my genius sister just opened the car door
[18/07/2025, 10.42.15] Ems : We're going 140
[18/07/2025, 10.42.19] Ems : I had a heart attack
[18/07/2025, 10.42.27] Yousif Zaid: My uh
[18/07/2025, 10.42.30] Yousif Zaid: How do you say
[18/07/2025, 10.42.40] Yousif Zaid: My regards for her have just gone up a lot
[18/07/2025, 10.42.45] Yousif Zaid: That’s a hilarious thing to do
[18/07/2025, 10.43.03] Yousif Zaid: She’s gonna make it in life
[18/07/2025, 10.43.32] Ems : The reason why is even funnier
[18/07/2025, 10.44.09] Ems : We're drinking sprite and coke and it was spilling, so the obvious thing to do is open the car door
[18/07/2025, 10.44.12] Ems : Randomly
[18/07/2025, 10.44.21] Yousif Zaid: What
[18/07/2025, 10.44.37] Ems : This made me doubt it
[18/07/2025, 10.44.49] Yousif Zaid: I just physically mimicked out the act
[18/07/2025, 10.45.06] Yousif Zaid: Of spilling a sprite, then leaning over and opening a car door
[18/07/2025, 10.45.28] Yousif Zaid: I think she’s just smarter than either of us. I can’t even begin to understand
[18/07/2025, 10.46.56] Ems : Doesn't seem very natural right?
[18/07/2025, 10.47.03] Ems : She's above us
[18/07/2025, 10.47.09] Ems : I cannot
[18/07/2025, 10.47.34] Yousif Zaid: What is it about second born children?
[18/07/2025, 10.47.37] Yousif Zaid: What causes this

[18/07/2025, 10.49.22] Ems : They seem to care less somehow
[18/07/2025, 10.49.27] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
[18/07/2025, 10.49.37] Ems : Oh his face is the funniest thing
[18/07/2025, 10.50.21] Yousif Zaid: They’re like gerbils or hamsters
[18/07/2025, 10.51.19] Yousif Zaid: You ever notice how they never act normal? You take your pet hamster out of its cage and the first thing it does is jump into the ceiling fan
[18/07/2025, 10.51.26] Yousif Zaid: Spill a sprite? Let me open this door
[18/07/2025, 10.51.32] Yousif Zaid: Fascinating
[18/07/2025, 10.52.38] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[18/07/2025, 10.52.44] Ems : Something to think about
[18/07/2025, 10.53.01] Ems : The obvious answer is never the right one in their mind
[18/07/2025, 10.53.15] Yousif Zaid: None of my photos of ayman are even close to normal
[18/07/2025, 10.53.25] Yousif Zaid: It’s not like the nice pictures you have with your sister
[18/07/2025, 10.53.45] Yousif Zaid: He’s always either not wearing a shirt or not wearing pants
[18/07/2025, 10.54.58] Ems : Dude lives to be comfortable
[18/07/2025, 10.55.03] Ems : I respect that
[18/07/2025, 10.55.13] Yousif Zaid: He lives to make me uncomfortable
[18/07/2025, 10.55.22] Ems : I don't send you the really embarrassing ones

[20/07/2025, 08.41.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m dying
[20/07/2025, 08.42.09] Yousif Zaid: I feel like those Victorian English women that get sent out to the sea to fix their hysteria
[20/07/2025, 08.42.48] Ems : Is this your Catherine from wuthering heights moment?
[20/07/2025, 08.43.05] Yousif Zaid: Im dying of consumption
[20/07/2025, 08.43.52] Ems : How did you even get a cold

[20/07/2025, 08.44.08] Yousif Zaid: Victim blaming me is crazy
[20/07/2025, 08.44.32] Ems : It just seems like you want to have your Jane Austen moment
[20/07/2025, 08.44.51] Yousif Zaid: Guy who performatively gets sick so he can make literature references
[20/07/2025, 08.44.54] Yousif Zaid: This is embarrassing
[20/07/2025, 08.45.03] Ems : Honestly
[20/07/2025, 08.45.09] Ems : Is it just cold or also fever?
[20/07/2025, 08.45.17] Yousif Zaid: Fever
[20/07/2025, 08.45.21] Yousif Zaid: Entire body aches

[20/07/2025, 08.46.23] Yousif Zaid: Good thing you’re not a doctor
[20/07/2025, 08.46.40] Yousif Zaid: Actually my friend had something like a stroke yesterday I’m very worried for him
[20/07/2025, 08.46.55] Ems : Has it been just today or also yesterday?
[20/07/2025, 08.47.00] Yousif Zaid: Half his face drooped and went numb and so did his arm and he stopped being able to talk he’s in the hospital
[20/07/2025, 08.47.01] Ems : Shit who?
[20/07/2025, 08.47.23] Yousif Zaid: Omar, the guy whose graduation party had the belly dancer that ruined my reputation as a pure young man
[20/07/2025, 08.47.27] Ems : I'm really sorry is he ok now?
[20/07/2025, 08.47.46] Ems : The prospect ruiner
[20/07/2025, 08.47.49] Yousif Zaid: I fucking hope so he’s in the hospital making jokes about how he’s “stroking” in multiple ways
[20/07/2025, 08.47.59] Yousif Zaid: Dumbass is gonna die joking about touching himself
[20/07/2025, 08.48.26] Yousif Zaid: Fever hit last night

[20/07/2025, 08.51.03] Yousif Zaid: He’s never taken a thing seriously in his life, I love the guy
[20/07/2025, 08.51.35] Yousif Zaid: It was really funny he sent a photo of himself in the hospital to the cousin group chat literally nobody asked if he was okay people were just typing shit like “stop attention seeking”
[20/07/2025, 08.51.45] Yousif Zaid: “Did they put a finger in your butt?”
[20/07/2025, 08.52.06] Yousif Zaid: “Did it feel nice?” His own sister didn’t even ask what happened
[20/07/2025, 08.52.14] Ems : Hahahahahahahaj

[20/07/2025, 08.54.45] Ems : I woke up this morning at 7 and read while the sun was coming up
[20/07/2025, 08.54.49] Ems : It's the best
[20/07/2025, 08.55.04] Yousif Zaid: I woke myself up by coughing at 8 but I can sit and read
[20/07/2025, 08.55.26] Yousif Zaid: I know you deserve this nice vacation but I also kind of hate your guts
[20/07/2025, 08.55.32] Yousif Zaid: This is so beautiful
[20/07/2025, 08.55.57] Yousif Zaid: Also you probably looked goofy with that snorkel on your face
[20/07/2025, 08.56.13] Ems : Not sure why I deserve it but I'm really happy to be here
[20/07/2025, 08.56.19] Ems : There's a picture of it
[20/07/2025, 08.56.22] Ems : It's so funny
[20/07/2025, 08.56.46] Ems : I'll show it in person it cannot stay on someone else's phone
[20/07/2025, 08.57.02] Yousif Zaid: That’s better anyhow
[20/07/2025, 08.57.10] Yousif Zaid: Give us something to talk about and show when we meet up
[20/07/2025, 09.04.54] Yousif Zaid: Omar just texted us that he’s made it out the hospital and the first reply was someone saying “that’s a shame I wanted to take your grandma out on a date and console her”
[20/07/2025, 10.08.46] Ems : I'm sure we'll have something to say after months
[20/07/2025, 10.09.06] Ems : I have to meet him he sounds so fun
[20/07/2025, 10.10.26] Yousif Zaid: Maybe one day, at my graduation party
[20/07/2025, 10.11.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m really craving an entire rotisserie chicken is that normal
[20/07/2025, 10.17.44] Ems : Honestly yeah
[20/07/2025, 10.18.07] Ems : I really want meat as well
[20/07/2025, 10.18.35] Yousif Zaid: Like no fries no rice nothing on the side
[20/07/2025, 10.18.42] Yousif Zaid: Me, an entire chicken and privacy
[20/07/2025, 10.18.42] Ems : There's a friend of the guy who drives the boat here until the 21st who doesn't eat meat so we're not buying it
[20/07/2025, 10.18.51] Ems : I'm having withdrawals
[20/07/2025, 10.18.58] Yousif Zaid: What a wanker
[20/07/2025, 10.19.00] Ems : I'm like that as well
[20/07/2025, 10.19.04] Ems : Right
[20/07/2025, 10.19.21] Ems : Would you make it or buy it?
[20/07/2025, 10.19.30] Ems : The ones at the store always look amazing
[20/07/2025, 10.19.37] Yousif Zaid: Yes I want a store bought one
[20/07/2025, 10.20.03] Yousif Zaid: I genuinely don’t get it
[20/07/2025, 10.20.28] Yousif Zaid: I let people eat pork infront of me. In fact it’s not even a “I let them” I just have no right to decide or even have an opinion
[20/07/2025, 10.20.57] Yousif Zaid: Making the entire boat vegetarian is nuts
[20/07/2025, 10.22.01] Ems : No it's not that she doesn't let us it's that we don't buy it to not cook too many different things

[21/07/2025, 00.06.07] Yousif Zaid: did a big integral thingy to see that our Tanh function squeezes our variance by 5/3 so we need to multiply our layer outputs by that 5/3 number to unsqueeze it. less interesting tonight, mostly statistics stuff

[21/07/2025, 20.53.52] Yousif Zaid: I would drink rat poison and be fine with it if I was sipping it somewhere that pretty
[21/07/2025, 20.53.54] Ems : Ok but if the fever's gone hopefully you'll be fine by tomorrow
[21/07/2025, 20.54.11] Yousif Zaid: Yes hopefully the people at DTU need their gods chosen receptionist to return

[22/07/2025, 16.53.35] Yousif Zaid: Milk buying championships 2025

[22/07/2025, 16.54.00] Ems : You are on track for gold
[22/07/2025, 16.54.05] Yousif Zaid: You’re on vacation take a nap in the sun
[22/07/2025, 16.54.40] Yousif Zaid: This reminds me of the small incident on the boat when I went with Dmitri and Johan last
[22/07/2025, 16.54.40] Ems : I think Denmark shifted your perception of how hot it actually is
If I fall asleep in the sun I'll die there
[22/07/2025, 16.54.51] Ems : Please do tell
[22/07/2025, 16.55.01] Yousif Zaid: Dmitri has a fever and is sleeping below deck
[22/07/2025, 16.55.14] Yousif Zaid: I’m on deck with Johan reading, and I decide to nap a little bit
[22/07/2025, 16.55.29] Yousif Zaid: Before I sleep I see land pretty close
[22/07/2025, 16.56.01] Yousif Zaid: I wake up half an hour later. Johan, the guy who is supposed to be steering, is laying down and is asleep with his hand on the rudder
[22/07/2025, 16.56.30] Yousif Zaid: I look around and can barely see the coast like we’re really fucking far away
[22/07/2025, 16.57.38] Yousif Zaid: I got real nervous but I woke him up and he checked his watch and guaranteed me that he was only sleeping for 5 minutes and that we were still kind of on course. Nothing happened of it but I got a good scare
[22/07/2025, 16.58.07] Yousif Zaid: Sun screen on the eyelids, or just sleep below deck
[22/07/2025, 17.18.58] Ems : How tf did you get that far in 5 minutes
[22/07/2025, 17.19.08] Ems : Honestly it sounds like you guys were lost without me
[22/07/2025, 17.19.46] Ems : Yeah true I went for another swim instead though
[22/07/2025, 17.19.47] Yousif Zaid: We didn’t, the course was apparently to go away from land, but I didn’t know that. I just fell asleep and woke up and thought we were lost at sea
[22/07/2025, 17.20.08] Ems : I can clearly see you panicking
[22/07/2025, 17.20.14] Ems : I have the image on mind
[22/07/2025, 17.20.21] Yousif Zaid: It was like a
[22/07/2025, 17.20.57] Yousif Zaid: Blank stare
[22/07/2025, 17.21.34] Yousif Zaid: Don’t flatter yourself
[22/07/2025, 17.21.47] Yousif Zaid: I will admit it was less fun without you
[22/07/2025, 17.23.30] Ems : Hahahahhahaha it's funny because that's always your first reaction to a problem
[22/07/2025, 17.23.37] Ems : Right
[22/07/2025, 17.24.03] Ems : At least there's that
[22/07/2025, 17.24.13] Yousif Zaid: “I should probably wake him up”
[22/07/2025, 17.27.25] Ems : When do you get vacation from work? Are you working until your trip?
[22/07/2025, 17.27.58] Yousif Zaid: It’s very relaxed for me, I can pretty much stop working whenever but as long as I have nothing to do I show up to work
[22/07/2025, 17.28.44] Yousif Zaid: Why?
[22/07/2025, 17.32.59] Ems : Just wondering if you have work all of August
[22/07/2025, 17.33.01] Ems : No reason
[22/07/2025, 17.34.52] Yousif Zaid: It’s not so much have to as “might as well if there’s nothing better to do” but yeah I’ll probably just work
[22/07/2025, 17.37.38] Yousif Zaid: Work exercise nerd shit and read. It’s productive I guess but nothing exciting
[22/07/2025, 19.11.22] Ems : It actually sounds very nice
[22/07/2025, 19.11.35] Ems : I'm regretting the fact that I'll go to ponza in August
[22/07/2025, 19.11.49] Ems : I want to be with the family considering I'm never there
[22/07/2025, 19.12.05] Ems : image omitted
[22/07/2025, 19.12.43] Yousif Zaid: I don’t even know where that is
[22/07/2025, 19.12.58] Yousif Zaid: Too late to cancel then?
[22/07/2025, 19.13.23] Yousif Zaid: Emma the barmaid. You’ve never mixed bullshit I think you got it
[22/07/2025, 19.13.25] Yousif Zaid: What is that?

[22/07/2025, 20.24.56] Yousif Zaid: Again, another one of your ideas that sounds gross to me but probably is delicious
[22/07/2025, 20.25.14] Ems : I turned it on you
[22/07/2025, 20.25.44] Yousif Zaid: Next gathering we’re at when I want a concoction I’m just gonna yell “barmaid!!!” at you like some kind of Viking

[22/07/2025, 20.29.50] Ems : You might have to shave your beard
[22/07/2025, 20.30.12] Yousif Zaid: There are other complications to this plan also
[22/07/2025, 20.30.24] Ems : I think it's mainly that
[22/07/2025, 20.30.47] Ems : But I'm sure I'll have fun it's not me complaining
[22/07/2025, 20.31.03] Yousif Zaid: I know I know I’m the one complaining

[22/07/2025, 20.36.43] Ems : I burst out laughing that was on point
[22/07/2025, 20.36.58] Yousif Zaid: But to behead her is insane

[23/07/2025, 11.27.21] Ems : Fuck I'm on a boat I have nothing
[23/07/2025, 11.27.35] Yousif Zaid: I’m in a humid office but I have nicotine
[23/07/2025, 11.27.52] Yousif Zaid: Is it better to be loveless In heaven or to be paolo and Francesca in hell
[23/07/2025, 11.28.12] Ems : video omitted
[23/07/2025, 11.28.19] Yousif Zaid: I have my Francesca and her name is Snus Lyft Cold Air
[23/07/2025, 11.28.25] Ems : That's the question
[23/07/2025, 11.28.39] Ems : She should be grape snus
[23/07/2025, 11.28.48] Yousif Zaid: That’s the Swedish mistress
[23/07/2025, 11.29.35] Yousif Zaid: I’m glad my retardation brings you some comfort
[23/07/2025, 11.29.44] Ems : Oh I see
[23/07/2025, 11.29.56] Ems : But it's not YOUR retardation
[23/07/2025, 11.29.59] Ems : It's ours
[23/07/2025, 11.30.09] Ems : That's what's making it better
[23/07/2025, 11.30.10] Yousif Zaid: That’s sweet, in a way, isn’t it?
[23/07/2025, 11.30.15] Ems : Very
[23/07/2025, 11.30.24] Ems : We're screwed
[23/07/2025, 11.30.31] Yousif Zaid: I wouldn’t say we’re screwed
[23/07/2025, 11.30.39] Ems : Curve?
[23/07/2025, 11.30.47] Yousif Zaid: Think about our competition here
[23/07/2025, 11.31.18] Ems : I like the way you think, the other retards are more retarded
[23/07/2025, 11.31.33] Yousif Zaid: I can confidently say you’re probably like in the top 5 smartest people I know here at dtu so if we both got the same thing then I’m quite satisfied
[23/07/2025, 11.31.40] Yousif Zaid: The average must be 2/14 then
[23/07/2025, 11.31.47] Yousif Zaid: Proof by arrogance
[23/07/2025, 11.32.28] Ems : First off that's a complete lie
[23/07/2025, 11.32.44] Ems : But I thought the same when you said your result
[23/07/2025, 11.32.49] Ems : So it's fine
[23/07/2025, 11.33.17] Yousif Zaid: Or at the very least top 5 work ethic/results
[23/07/2025, 11.33.43] Yousif Zaid: Well I won’t be bashful and I’ll just believe you
[23/07/2025, 11.34.32] Ems : Ok I can accept that
[23/07/2025, 11.34.51] Yousif Zaid: Which might as well be the same thing
[23/07/2025, 11.35.06] Yousif Zaid: God didn’t give me Aidan brain cells but he made me stubborn
[23/07/2025, 11.35.27] Yousif Zaid: The average must be 3/14
[23/07/2025, 11.36.14] Yousif Zaid: It has to be
[23/07/2025, 11.36.49] Ems : We'll stand by this
[23/07/2025, 11.36.58] Ems : I hope no one proves us wrong
[23/07/2025, 11.37.10] Yousif Zaid: I don’t care if anyone proves us wrong
[23/07/2025, 11.37.14] Yousif Zaid: Mechanics are gay anyway
[23/07/2025, 11.37.21] Yousif Zaid: Ball rolling down a hill how fast does it go
[23/07/2025, 11.37.24] Yousif Zaid: Who gives a fuck
[23/07/2025, 11.37.46] Ems : If anything it's inertia

[23/07/2025, 11.39.20] Ems : There's a whole other semester of it don't worry
[23/07/2025, 11.40.05] Yousif Zaid: Next semester is cooler stuff. Electromagnetism
[23/07/2025, 11.40.12] Yousif Zaid: Yo I’m in a lab and I’m hearing an alarm

[23/07/2025, 11.41.11] Ems : Why are you telling me get out hahahahaha
[23/07/2025, 11.41.36] Ems : Has something exploded?
[23/07/2025, 11.42.06] Yousif Zaid: My fingers don’t bend so good no more
[23/07/2025, 11.44.38] Ems : What
[23/07/2025, 11.44.50] Yousif Zaid: Might grow an extra nose
[23/07/2025, 11.44.58] Ems : Well shit
[23/07/2025, 11.45.33] Ems : Is it radiation?
[23/07/2025, 11.45.41] Ems : Do you get superpowers now
[23/07/2025, 11.46.00] Yousif Zaid: I wonder what would be the best one
[23/07/2025, 11.46.58] Ems : Either teleportation or superbrain
[23/07/2025, 11.47.02] Ems : No?
[23/07/2025, 11.47.42] Yousif Zaid: I think the radiation might just make me more retarded
[23/07/2025, 11.48.09] Ems : I wonder what that would look like
[23/07/2025, 11.48.35] Yousif Zaid: Probably the same but I just get more arrogant
[23/07/2025, 11.51.55] Yousif Zaid: There’s only up to question 14 in the answer key
[23/07/2025, 12.44.20] Yousif Zaid: I just came to the apartment to pick up Norwegian wood and I saw Claudio laying down sleeping on the couch no blanket with all the lights off it was the sorriest sight I’ve seen in my life
[23/07/2025, 13.12.34] Ems : I know I almost don't want to know 15
[23/07/2025, 13.12.46] Ems : Hahahahahahahahah
[23/07/2025, 13.12.51] Ems : Did you wake him
[23/07/2025, 13.31.34] Yousif Zaid: Yes
[23/07/2025, 13.31.38] Yousif Zaid: Apartment was a mess
[23/07/2025, 14.06.35] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[23/07/2025, 14.06.39] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[23/07/2025, 14.06.58] Yousif Zaid: Getting paid to deliver beakers to a company near the airport
[23/07/2025, 14.28.08] Ems : Getting paid to listen to these bangers in the car is such a cheat code
[23/07/2025, 14.28.22] Ems : What car is it?
[23/07/2025, 14.28.31] Ems : It isn't the aygo
[23/07/2025, 14.29.09] Ems : Also I love how you don't care about using your hands for driving when a good song comes on
[23/07/2025, 14.29.14] Ems : You have priorities
[23/07/2025, 14.29.33] Yousif Zaid: Volkswagen Golf TSI
[23/07/2025, 14.29.39] Yousif Zaid: It goes fast
[23/07/2025, 14.37.23] Yousif Zaid: Emma you’re smart let me ask you something
[23/07/2025, 14.39.39] Yousif Zaid: The work at dtu is interesting but not that interesting. Thing is, it’s really convenient, the office is right there on campus. My neighbor John works at rambøll, which is an engineering company, where the work would be much more relevant, and he can probably help me get an interview or something.
[23/07/2025, 14.40.15] Yousif Zaid: You reckon it’s worth giving up the safety and convenience and stress free work at dtu for something more exciting, relevant and probably better paying?
[23/07/2025, 14.42.59] Ems : I think you should definitely try
Get yourself that interview and see if you would even get the job
What you have now is very convenient, which may be better for next year considering how many courses we'll have, but if the other job is overall better then it might be worth considering
[23/07/2025, 14.43.15] Ems : How far is the other job from dtu
[23/07/2025, 14.45.20] Yousif Zaid: Rambøll is in Ørstad, near the airport [23/07/2025, 14.46.02] Ems : I think you should write out your schedule for next semester
[23/07/2025, 14.46.27] Ems : image omitted
[23/07/2025, 14.46.33] Ems : Like I know this will be mine
[23/07/2025, 14.46.45] Ems : The days are in Italian but you get the gist
[23/07/2025, 14.46.53] Yousif Zaid: Didn’t realise the days in Italian are like French
[23/07/2025, 14.47.18] Yousif Zaid: Alright I’ll see how it looks on my outlook calendar
[23/07/2025, 14.47.17] Ems : Yeah very similar
[23/07/2025, 14.47.47] Ems : If you have all afternoons as well then I'm not sure it would be smart to go that far
[23/07/2025, 14.53.08] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[23/07/2025, 14.53.10] Yousif Zaid: Hm
[23/07/2025, 14.54.40] Yousif Zaid: That Monday is looking awful btw
[23/07/2025, 14.54.54] Ems : You probably could make it work but it would be very time consuming
[23/07/2025, 14.55.01] Ems : How much better would the job be
[23/07/2025, 14.55.20] Ems : My schedule is absolute shit
[23/07/2025, 14.55.32] Yousif Zaid: Student worker at their “Data and Technologies” department

[23/07/2025, 14.56.24] Ems : Yeah but how much better for you
[23/07/2025, 14.56.36] Ems : .

[23/07/2025, 14.56.54] Yousif Zaid: Uuuurgghhhhhhhh
[23/07/2025, 14.57.19] Ems : I think we only have maths and physics together this semester
[23/07/2025, 14.57.33] Yousif Zaid: ^
[23/07/2025, 14.57.43] Ems : Yeah
[23/07/2025, 14.57.45] Ems : I agree
[23/07/2025, 14.57.59] Yousif Zaid: I hope it’s a GE only thing at least
[23/07/2025, 14.58.24] Yousif Zaid: The idea of vedant being like “hey I took the English version of this course !”
[23/07/2025, 15.00.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[23/07/2025, 15.00.12] Yousif Zaid: Yeah it’s over I might drop out he’s gonna be there

[23/07/2025, 15.00.50] Ems : Even with other 5 couses
[23/07/2025, 15.01.02] Ems : Better than vedant
[23/07/2025, 15.01.06] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[23/07/2025, 15.01.21] Ems : .
[23/07/2025, 15.01.38] Yousif Zaid: I keep seeing him like posts on Instagram
[23/07/2025, 15.01.53] Yousif Zaid: But they’re all just like racist against Arabs
[23/07/2025, 15.02.24] Yousif Zaid: The post is like “we shouldn’t let Arabs into Europe!!” And it just says liked by Vedant under them
[23/07/2025, 15.02.52] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[23/07/2025, 15.03.07] Yousif Zaid: It’s fucking killing me man
[23/07/2025, 15.03.15] Ems : That man keeps getting better and better
[23/07/2025, 15.03.26] Yousif Zaid: Like why’s he even want to hang out with me
[23/07/2025, 15.03.39] Ems : He's such a random appearance as well
[23/07/2025, 15.03.50] Ems : Like how tf do I know him

[23/07/2025, 15.03.58] Ems : Just why
[23/07/2025, 15.04.13] Yousif Zaid: The absolute disgust is palpable even through your texts
[23/07/2025, 15.04.29] Ems : I don't even try to hide it
[23/07/2025, 15.04.33] Yousif Zaid: Why does he know my name
[23/07/2025, 15.04.37] Yousif Zaid: Wow
[23/07/2025, 15.04.42] Ems : Just why
[23/07/2025, 15.04.56] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know what to make of the whole Arab thing either
[23/07/2025, 15.05.04] Yousif Zaid: Maybe that’s my excuse to be hostile to him
[23/07/2025, 15.05.16] Yousif Zaid: I don’t even really mind you know but I can act all high and mighty about it
[23/07/2025, 15.05.51] Ems : You don't need an excuse
[23/07/2025, 15.06.01] Ems : But this definitely gives you one
[23/07/2025, 15.06.08] Yousif Zaid: It’s just

[23/07/2025, 15.06.20] Ems : I'm pretty sure he's not even hostile though
[23/07/2025, 15.06.31] Ems : He doesn't know which button is like probably
[23/07/2025, 15.06.46] Yousif Zaid: That’s what I thought too
[23/07/2025, 15.06.56] Yousif Zaid: “Don’t let Mohammad into Denmark!”
[23/07/2025, 15.06.59] Yousif Zaid: Liked by vedant
[23/07/2025, 15.07.03] Yousif Zaid: Baffling
[23/07/2025, 15.07.12] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
[23/07/2025, 15.07.34] Ems : I can imagine him not knowing what is being said and then pressing a random button
[23/07/2025, 15.07.50] Yousif Zaid: He’s so goofy I’m not even mad
[23/07/2025, 15.07.55] Yousif Zaid: Cuz this is accurate you know
[23/07/2025, 15.08.13] Ems : Now you can dislike him without feeling guilty
[23/07/2025, 15.08.24] Yousif Zaid: I disliked him before
[23/07/2025, 15.08.34] Ems : But you felt guilty
[23/07/2025, 15.08.37] Yousif Zaid: Maybe I can throw a plate of food at him now
[23/07/2025, 15.08.55] Yousif Zaid: You can act all offended on my behalf too

[23/07/2025, 15.09.11] Ems : I'll throw the plate
[23/07/2025, 15.09.37] Yousif Zaid: Trying not to burst out laughing watching me fake being offended
[23/07/2025, 15.09.42] Yousif Zaid: “How… dare you!!”

[23/07/2025, 15.56.37] Ems : But then you just look really upset
[23/07/2025, 17.18.29] Yousif Zaid: The upset is at me having nothing good to say back
[23/07/2025, 19.29.47] Yousif Zaid: Well that first chapter kind of made me feel dread
[23/07/2025, 19.54.21] Ems : If you say so, you do get really annoyed
[23/07/2025, 19.54.27] Ems : Ok fair enough
[23/07/2025, 19.54.35] Ems : Go on though and let me know
[23/07/2025, 19.54.47] Yousif Zaid: The guys roommate is funny
[23/07/2025, 19.55.00] Yousif Zaid: Kind of reminds me of a guy I know
[23/07/2025, 19.55.12] Ems : He is
[23/07/2025, 19.55.21] Ems : Who?
[23/07/2025, 19.55.38] Yousif Zaid: He doesn’t act like Claudio but speaks exactly like him
[23/07/2025, 19.56.07] Ems : Do you read him in Claudio's voice?
[23/07/2025, 19.56.16] Yousif Zaid: What did you think of the book? It’s a bit fun to read it and think “oh emma has been here before”. Like the crease in the spine
[23/07/2025, 19.56.57] Ems : I actually didn't think so when I read it
But I guess you do know better since you're his roommate
[23/07/2025, 19.57.41] Ems : I won't tell you what I thought until the end, I'll call you and we'll talk about it
But I think it's so fun we're reading the same one
[23/07/2025, 19.58.59] Yousif Zaid: I think that its because it’s the exact same copy. There’s an effect there I’m not sure how to put it
[23/07/2025, 19.59.52] Yousif Zaid: you didn’t remove the price tag off the back
[23/07/2025, 20.17.30] Ems : I wouldn't touch it
[23/07/2025, 20.17.55] Ems : I wanted it to still be your book [23/07/2025, 20.18.34] Ems : I try not to crease and ruin books especially if they're other people's
[23/07/2025, 20.29.24] Yousif Zaid: I’d have absentmindedly removed it
[23/07/2025, 20.51.37] Ems : I do that with beers
[23/07/2025, 20.54.51] Yousif Zaid: Asked John to jog with me and he couldn’t cuz he had to put his infant to sleep
[23/07/2025, 20.54.59] Yousif Zaid: That baby is getting in the way of our relationship
[23/07/2025, 21.03.49] Ems : Honestly you should complain to the wife
[23/07/2025, 21.03.54] Ems : How dare they
[23/07/2025, 21.04.06] Yousif Zaid: What exactly is she doing in this equation
[23/07/2025, 21.04.15] Yousif Zaid: When I knocked on the door she was just lounging on the couch
[23/07/2025, 21.04.22] Yousif Zaid: “Oh John is putting Julia to sleep sorry he can’t come” [23/07/2025, 21.04.49] Yousif Zaid: The nerve of some people
[23/07/2025, 21.07.58] Ems : Honestly you're so right
[23/07/2025, 21.08.07] Ems : Loungin on the couch
[23/07/2025, 21.08.08] Ems : Wtf
[23/07/2025, 21.33.47] Ems : You know how I told you I got stung on the tongue by a wasp once? Today I had to fight off more wasps than ever before
[23/07/2025, 21.34.07] Ems : They were literally everywhere
[23/07/2025, 21.34.48] Yousif Zaid: What did you do to insult them?
[23/07/2025, 21.35.46] Ems : Nothing
The attacking was continuous
[23/07/2025, 21.35.52] Ems : The whole afternoon
[23/07/2025, 21.36.02] Ems : It was a test of my patience
[23/07/2025, 21.36.09] Yousif Zaid: did you try to kiss one of them again
[23/07/2025, 21.36.38] Ems : [23/07/2025, 21.36.49] Ems : Bitch was on my burger
[23/07/2025, 21.37.16] Yousif Zaid: you couldn't let him have a bite without harassing the poor guy?
[23/07/2025, 21.38.37] Yousif Zaid: the coolest moment i ever had in middle school was when a bee landed on my neck during our long walk to the aquarium
[23/07/2025, 21.39.02] Yousif Zaid: and everyone was young and scared of bees and "ahhhh!!!!" but i was just like "let him rest on my neck it's okay" and i walked him like 3 km to the aquarium
[23/07/2025, 21.42.04] Ems : Istg today they were really testing my patience
[23/07/2025, 21.42.08] Ems : I was reading
[23/07/2025, 21.42.20] Ems : You must've been the coolest kid in school
[23/07/2025, 21.42.22] Yousif Zaid: btw are you actually reading blood meridian on a catamaran
[23/07/2025, 21.42.24] Ems : Walking the bee
[23/07/2025, 21.42.41] Yousif Zaid: i was a fat loser with a ponytail but yes the bee fixed everything
[23/07/2025, 21.42.56] Ems : I finished brave new world today so tomorrow I will be
[23/07/2025, 21.43.09] Ems : Bees tend to do that
[23/07/2025, 21.43.16] Yousif Zaid: unless you kiss them of course
[23/07/2025, 21.43.23] Ems : Did you actually have a ponytail
[23/07/2025, 21.43.31] Yousif Zaid: i read news articles of little girls in the states kissing frogs and getting salmonella
[23/07/2025, 21.44.10] Ems : I think it was the other way around, it wanted to kiss me
[23/07/2025, 21.44.10] Yousif Zaid: i in fact did. with a terrible undercut. and i hadn't realised that i should be shaving my arabic built in mono-brow
[23/07/2025, 21.44.34] Ems : Ok I'm not that stupid
[23/07/2025, 21.44.38] Ems : I think

[23/07/2025, 21.45.10] Ems : But this is super cute
[23/07/2025, 21.45.19] Ems : You're being mean to yourself
[23/07/2025, 21.45.28] Yousif Zaid: when i say "loser" i mean personality wise
[23/07/2025, 21.45.35] Yousif Zaid: i was a pretentious little snobby cunt
[23/07/2025, 21.45.52] Ems : You know what I'm about to say right
[23/07/2025, 21.45.55] Yousif Zaid: mhm.
[23/07/2025, 21.45.59] Ems : Ok
[23/07/2025, 21.46.00] Yousif Zaid: pull the plaster off do it
[23/07/2025, 21.46.13] Ems : Nah it's ok I'll leave it there
[23/07/2025, 21.46.18] Yousif Zaid: that hurts more.
[23/07/2025, 21.46.36] Yousif Zaid: i thought i was so deep and emotionally mature because i listened to classic rock
[23/07/2025, 21.46.53] Yousif Zaid: that the height of sophistication and art was "killer queen" by queen
[23/07/2025, 21.47.08] Yousif Zaid: and i looked down on people who listened to modern music
[23/07/2025, 21.47.15] Ems : You think so because I didn't say anything
[23/07/2025, 21.47.25] Yousif Zaid: ow
[23/07/2025, 21.47.27] Ems : How old was this? 12?
[23/07/2025, 21.47.35] Yousif Zaid: yeah thereabouts
[23/07/2025, 21.47.43] Yousif Zaid: lasted til i was 14? 15?
[23/07/2025, 21.47.47] Ems : Masterpiece if you ask me
[23/07/2025, 21.48.07] Yousif Zaid: hey its a great song but so is "Toxic" by britney spears
[23/07/2025, 21.48.12] Yousif Zaid: you couldn't convince 13 year old me of that
[23/07/2025, 21.48.26] Ems : Ok but I think it's reasonable, if you had said 17 I would be worried
[23/07/2025, 21.48.40] Yousif Zaid: i look back on it with horror
[23/07/2025, 21.49.07] Ems : I looked down on everyone else for listening to Italian music if it makes you feel better
[23/07/2025, 21.49.34] Yousif Zaid: it doesn't
[23/07/2025, 21.49.34] Ems : I still think it's mostly shit but some songs are masterpieces
[23/07/2025, 21.49.43] Yousif Zaid: i wish i could go back in time and shove young me into a garbage bin
[23/07/2025, 21.50.52] Ems : You're way too mean
12 year old Emma was a little shit but I would die protecting her
[23/07/2025, 21.50.54] Yousif Zaid: in my defence i feel like i've improved! i let people enjoy things and don't judge. or at least i think i do
[23/07/2025, 21.51.22] Ems : I think you're probably misremembering yourself
[23/07/2025, 21.51.24] Ems : Honestly
[23/07/2025, 21.51.27] Yousif Zaid: sometimes protecting someone means shoving them into a locker so they develop a better personality
[23/07/2025, 21.51.55] Yousif Zaid: i remember i'd actually get mad when the kids in my class would sing "perfect" by ed sheeran
[23/07/2025, 21.51.57] Yousif Zaid: idk what my problem was
[23/07/2025, 21.52.08] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[23/07/2025, 21.52.21] Yousif Zaid: so embarrassing
[23/07/2025, 21.52.38] Ems : Were you already friends with Sebastian then?
[23/07/2025, 21.52.53] Yousif Zaid: sebastian and i met during the first year of high school. i must have been 17
[23/07/2025, 21.53.05] Yousif Zaid: half the girls in my class thought i was gay
[23/07/2025, 21.53.16] Yousif Zaid: including the girl i ended up dating during high school
[23/07/2025, 21.53.55] Ems : Oh my timeline was fucked
[23/07/2025, 21.54.05] Ems : Reason?
[23/07/2025, 21.54.12] Ems : Ohh yeah you told me
[23/07/2025, 21.54.21] Ems : And you thought she was a lesbian
[23/07/2025, 21.54.25] Yousif Zaid: god knows
[23/07/2025, 21.54.42] Yousif Zaid: i'm a bit "extra" i guess? loud?
[23/07/2025, 21.55.52] Ems : I won't deny that but it doesn't make me automatically assume you're gay
[23/07/2025, 21.56.11] Yousif Zaid: i also had a collection of shirts at the time that happened to have
[23/07/2025, 21.56.15] Yousif Zaid: floral patterns
[23/07/2025, 21.57.33] Ems : Mmm ok
[23/07/2025, 21.57.52] Ems : That's more of a reason if you say "collection"
[23/07/2025, 21.57.57] Yousif Zaid: there was like
[23/07/2025, 21.57.58] Yousif Zaid: 5 of them
[23/07/2025, 21.58.17] Ems : Then don't blame it on your personality
[23/07/2025, 22.04.18] Yousif Zaid: gay ass shirts
[23/07/2025, 22.04.31] Yousif Zaid: anyway, i'm gonna do some nerd shit now.
[23/07/2025, 22.05.14] Yousif Zaid: normally my name maker chain rule thing is just one line of code:
loss.backward()
i'm gonna sit down with some math and make this .backward() function myself
[23/07/2025, 23.47.51] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/07/2025, 07.10.31] Ems : This is kind of hard for me to understand, did you manage to do the function?
[24/07/2025, 08.00.32] Yousif Zaid: I did a 10th of it
[24/07/2025, 08.01.19] Yousif Zaid: The code I was sending you earlier was built of pre-made functions that had gradient stuff built in, now I’m working backwards and by hand and actually have to do the math
[24/07/2025, 09.38.56] Ems : Ohhh nice
[24/07/2025, 09.40.34] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/07/2025, 10.43.06] Ems : Oh well you tried

[24/07/2025, 10.45.04] Yousif Zaid: The pigs took their little piglets out for a day in the beach :)
[24/07/2025, 10.45.23] Yousif Zaid: I really hope you got some photos
[24/07/2025, 10.47.00] Yousif Zaid: You know people always speak badly of pigs saying they are dirty but these ones are bathing
[24/07/2025, 11.01.40] Ems : I did not
[24/07/2025, 11.01.45] Ems : Unfortunately
[24/07/2025, 11.01.54] Ems : Exactly they were so so cute
[24/07/2025, 11.21.55] Yousif Zaid: You deleted this message.
[24/07/2025, 11.22.00] Yousif Zaid: Inspiration struck

[24/07/2025, 12.48.47] Ems : I love this
[24/07/2025, 12.49.03] Ems : Very very accurate
[24/07/2025, 12.49.33] Ems : The sun's realism could be questioned
[24/07/2025, 12.49.45] Ems : But the vibe and the pigs are perfect
[24/07/2025, 12.49.46] Yousif Zaid: Not sure why it’s an oval
[24/07/2025, 12.49.55] Ems : Inspiration struck
[24/07/2025, 12.50.02] Yousif Zaid: It’s abstract
[24/07/2025, 12.50.11] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/07/2025, 12.51.10] Ems : Oh lord you're living the dream
[24/07/2025, 12.51.27] Ems : Cake for doing your job?
[24/07/2025, 12.51.33] Ems : This is awesome
[24/07/2025, 12.51.42] Yousif Zaid: Happy about the tubes [24/07/2025, 12.51.58] Yousif Zaid: Had to do this cuz it’s ridiculous you didn’t take a photo
[24/07/2025, 12.52.57] Ems : I will start bringing cake to reward myself for going to school or something
[24/07/2025, 12.53.04] Ems : I asked my mom and neither did she
[24/07/2025, 12.53.11] Ems : I will look it up online
[24/07/2025, 12.53.13] Yousif Zaid: How does that even happen

[24/07/2025, 12.55.43] Ems : Phone free I guess?
[24/07/2025, 12.56.03] Ems : You're mean for saying this right now
[24/07/2025, 12.56.13] Yousif Zaid: Why
[24/07/2025, 12.57.41] Ems : I'm joking I just haven't smoked in a bit
[24/07/2025, 12.57.49] Ems : And no prospects for the future ahead
[24/07/2025, 12.58.14] Yousif Zaid: The second we make eye contact in Rome your neurons are gonna start firing at full speed because I will have a pack in my pocket
[24/07/2025, 12.59.08] Ems : I will have something in Albania with Marta and I have been smoking with my friends
[24/07/2025, 12.59.32] Ems : I just thought bringing vapes on a boat with the fam would be too dangerous
[24/07/2025, 12.59.34] Yousif Zaid: So it’ll be just me then. Cuz I’ve smoked like 3 cigs all summer
[24/07/2025, 12.59.54] Ems : I've been smoking terea not cigs
[24/07/2025, 13.00.00] Ems : So actually we're on the same boat
[24/07/2025, 13.00.05] Yousif Zaid: Terea?
[24/07/2025, 13.00.16] Yousif Zaid: Oh the bullshit
[24/07/2025, 13.00.34] Yousif Zaid: What’s changed really
[24/07/2025, 13.01.20] Ems : Ok right
[24/07/2025, 13.01.25] Ems : It's true but still
[24/07/2025, 13.01.41] Yousif Zaid: I’m in the same boat over here
[24/07/2025, 13.03.09] Ems : Fair so nothing has changed
[24/07/2025, 13.03.28] Yousif Zaid: I still remember distortion
[24/07/2025, 13.03.49] Yousif Zaid: The walk over to the station you were stumbling about a little bit muttering “no prospects :((“ to yourself
[24/07/2025, 13.04.03] Ems : Bitch you started that
[24/07/2025, 13.04.06] Ems : Fuck off
[24/07/2025, 13.04.22] Yousif Zaid: No no it was really cute I’m not making fun of you
[24/07/2025, 13.04.35] Ems : I was talking about cigs here and you're bringing drunk me into this
[24/07/2025, 13.04.56] Ems : Hahahahahahah distortion was the best thing I swear
[24/07/2025, 13.05.21] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes we say what we mean on accident
[24/07/2025, 13.06.21] Ems : You're very wise
[24/07/2025, 13.11.00] Ems : By the way remind me to give you brave new world you might like it
[24/07/2025, 13.11.14] Yousif Zaid: Deal
[24/07/2025, 13.11.24] Yousif Zaid: I’ve started to read much more I’m very happy about it
[24/07/2025, 13.11.50] Yousif Zaid: I’m really curious to hear your thoughts on blood meridian
[24/07/2025, 13.17.49] Ems : Maybe this is just me but I love reading a book and then something that's written or the storyline just connects to your daily life in a random moment
[24/07/2025, 13.18.25] Ems : I will be starting it today so I'll let you know, you made my expectations for it very high
[24/07/2025, 13.18.35] Yousif Zaid: I thought about all the walks in the forests when I read the first chapter of Norwegian wood [24/07/2025, 13.18.57] Yousif Zaid: My English teacher calls it the greatest American novel ever
[24/07/2025, 13.26.01] Ems : It really does remind of that doesn't it
[24/07/2025, 13.26.15] Ems : The expectations are high
[24/07/2025, 13.26.30] Yousif Zaid: The prose in the book is completely nuts
[24/07/2025, 13.26.38] Yousif Zaid: Like it’s so beautiful but also borderline unreadable
[24/07/2025, 13.27.48] Yousif Zaid: It reads like the scene in the odyssey where Odysseus slaughters everyone but also like the bible at the same time
[24/07/2025, 13.29.24] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes a book will make me want to behave differently . Like Aloshya from the brothers karamazov. He’s like the gentlest sweetest human being I’ve ever seen and I wish to be even 10% of that [24/07/2025, 13.31.20] Yousif Zaid: Or Robert Jordan in for whom the bell tolls
[24/07/2025, 14.08.59] Ems : So true I love when a book is that good
[24/07/2025, 15.15.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/07/2025, 15.25.40] Ems : I'm really glad you have your priorities straight
[24/07/2025, 15.25.50] Ems : And this isn't me being sarcastic
[24/07/2025, 15.25.58] Ems : Salsa is a necessity
[24/07/2025, 15.27.06] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[24/07/2025, 15.27.13] Yousif Zaid: For my efforts
[24/07/2025, 15.30.41] Ems : Wait are you joking about the price?
[24/07/2025, 15.30.46] Yousif Zaid: No
[24/07/2025, 15.30.49] Ems : You probably aren't knowing Denmark
[24/07/2025, 15.31.14] Ems : Wait let me guess the flavour
[24/07/2025, 15.31.44] Ems : I'm going to assume it's not vanilla bc then it would be fun to guess
[24/07/2025, 15.31.57] Ems : Salted caramel?
[24/07/2025, 15.32.15] Yousif Zaid: Hazelnut
[24/07/2025, 15.32.19] Yousif Zaid: It was fucking delicious

[24/07/2025, 19.23.08] Ems : In the best way
[24/07/2025, 19.23.39] Yousif Zaid: The kind of dream that soldiers have about their families in the trenches

[24/07/2025, 20.44.59] Yousif Zaid: There’s a certain DTU type
[24/07/2025, 20.45.06] Ems : Your face when you look at someone you don't respect is class

[24/07/2025, 21.21.19] Ems : No we've been sailing on lots of different islands we arrived in Ithaca this afternoon
[24/07/2025, 21.21.38] Yousif Zaid: I’ll stop prying and you can tell me all about your adventures when we’re in Rome

[24/07/2025, 21.45.35] Yousif Zaid: This really added to my life
[24/07/2025, 22.02.23] Ems : If I remember correctly it's not even the worst one
[24/07/2025, 22.02.41] Yousif Zaid: Ugh
[24/07/2025, 22.02.55] Yousif Zaid: It’s a difficult thing to do right on paper I think
[24/07/2025, 22.28.01] Ems : Yes but like
[24/07/2025, 22.28.50] Ems : There are ways and ways
[24/07/2025, 22.29.07] Yousif Zaid: You’re not wrong
[24/07/2025, 22.29.17] Yousif Zaid: Also why are all these women throwing themselves at him
[24/07/2025, 22.31.08] Ems : I think the point is that he sees himself in a worse light than the rest of the people do
[24/07/2025, 22.31.14] Ems : At least I see it this way
[24/07/2025, 22.32.24] Yousif Zaid: He can’t seem to get over the grief of losing that
[24/07/2025, 22.32.28] Yousif Zaid: Kiziausiau guy
[24/07/2025, 22.53.08] Ems : I won't say anything I think until you finish it

[24/07/2025, 22.53.28] Yousif Zaid: I’m chugging through it quickly
[24/07/2025, 22.53.40] Yousif Zaid: Much easier to read than the brothers. 100 pages down
[24/07/2025, 22.54.36] Yousif Zaid: also i'm reading it quickly because i want to talk about it with you
[24/07/2025, 22.56.34] Ems : Honestly I really want to know what you think
[24/07/2025, 22.56.42] Ems : I finished it in April I believe
[24/07/2025, 22.56.54] Yousif Zaid: can you tell me if you liked it?
[24/07/2025, 23.07.19] Ems : Honestly I was really unsure about some stuff
[24/07/2025, 23.07.32] Ems : But I think some parts are actually beautiful
[24/07/2025, 23.07.35] Ems : So yes
[24/07/2025, 23.08.11] Yousif Zaid: I see a lot of criticism on Twitter about how he writes women but I haven’t gotten far enough to form an opinion on that
[24/07/2025, 23.08.52] Ems : I read that too but I didn't find anything too bad
[24/07/2025, 23.09.04] Ems : Like obviously he's kind of weird
[24/07/2025, 23.09.19] Yousif Zaid: That’s an understatement
[24/07/2025, 23.10.42] Ems : Exactly
[25/07/2025, 00.26.01] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[25/07/2025, 08.21.03] Ems : The nerdy stuff is getting nerdier by the day

[25/07/2025, 08.21.52] Yousif Zaid: I caught it because I am a ninja
[25/07/2025, 08.23.44] Ems : That's impressive
[25/07/2025, 08.23.56] Ems : You should lower the vibration perhaps
[25/07/2025, 08.24.02] Ems : How does that even happen
[25/07/2025, 08.24.13] Yousif Zaid: It was pretty close to falling already
[25/07/2025, 08.24.22] Yousif Zaid: I should probably trim my beard I look like a terrorist
[25/07/2025, 08.24.44] Ems : What if you do a goatee
[25/07/2025, 08.24.50] Ems : That would be really funny
[25/07/2025, 08.25.00] Yousif Zaid: It adds 10 years to my age
[25/07/2025, 08.25.13] Ems : audio omitted
[25/07/2025, 08.25.26] Ems : Yeah don't do it
[25/07/2025, 08.25.46] Yousif Zaid: Did you send this voice message infront of her in this enclosed space
[25/07/2025, 08.26.15] Ems : audio omitted
[25/07/2025, 08.26.27] Ems : That's genius though I'll do that
[25/07/2025, 08.26.36] Yousif Zaid: The idea of you just saying that infront of her is really bitchy and funny you should do it
[25/07/2025, 08.26.43] Yousif Zaid: What’d she do to piss you off
[25/07/2025, 08.38.03] Yousif Zaid: You deleted this message.
[25/07/2025, 08.38.44] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[25/07/2025, 08.39.17] Ems : It's kind of long don't worry about it
[25/07/2025, 08.39.21] Ems : HAHAHAHAHSHAHAH
[25/07/2025, 08.39.26] Ems : It's you now
[25/07/2025, 08.39.39] Yousif Zaid: This is humiliating
[25/07/2025, 08.39.54] Ems : It is you can't say anything to me ever again
[25/07/2025, 08.40.16] Yousif Zaid: I must ask a white woman out
[25/07/2025, 08.40.20] Yousif Zaid: The urge
[25/07/2025, 08.41.09] Yousif Zaid: Being an Arab is ridiculous I have to shave my cheekbones otherwise my eyebrows literally curve around my eye sockets
[25/07/2025, 08.41.14] Yousif Zaid: A stupid existence
[25/07/2025, 08.42.20] Ems : The funny part is you literally had to draw one on my face
[25/07/2025, 08.42.24] Ems : Yours is natural
[25/07/2025, 08.50.40] Yousif Zaid: This is embarrassing
[25/07/2025, 08.53.08] Yousif Zaid: We all bleed red ems
[25/07/2025, 08.57.41] Yousif Zaid: Btw this is literally just not true
[25/07/2025, 09.06.21] Ems : Yes, we don't all have red dots naturally though
[25/07/2025, 09.06.36] Ems : I was trying to gaslight you
[25/07/2025, 09.06.50] Yousif Zaid: Try again bitch
[25/07/2025, 09.07.12] Yousif Zaid: You would if you had to shave a monobrow
[25/07/2025, 09.24.16] Ems : Woooow ok
[25/07/2025, 09.24.34] Yousif Zaid: My tummy aches
[25/07/2025, 09.25.02] Ems : Oh no
[25/07/2025, 09.25.44] Ems : It's one of those days for you huh
[25/07/2025, 09.27.14] Ems : By the way the situation diffused over here
[25/07/2025, 09.27.35] Ems : Which is good but that was a close call
[25/07/2025, 09.28.06] Ems : Because now we've left port so we're stuck with each other
[25/07/2025, 09.28.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m glad to hear it but was the problem?
[25/07/2025, 09.29.04] Yousif Zaid: Maybe you’re both on edge from nicotine withdrawals
[25/07/2025, 09.58.34] Ems : I wanted to go for a walk this morning and she got really upset that I didn't wake her up to go with her so she was angry. Later i was wearing a hat that I brought here but she said she had already decided to wear it today so I couldn't wear it
[25/07/2025, 09.58.51] Ems : To avoid having an intense anger attack I left the boat
[25/07/2025, 09.59.07] Yousif Zaid: You’re very lucky you know that
[25/07/2025, 09.59.13] Ems : Can I say it's been quite easy not to smoke surprisingly
[25/07/2025, 09.59.27] Yousif Zaid: I wish my brother would get mad at me for not waking him up to walk with me
[25/07/2025, 09.59.36] Yousif Zaid: Mine would attack me if I did wake him up to do something with me
[25/07/2025, 09.59.48] Yousif Zaid: Like physically he’d start throwing punches and elbows
[25/07/2025, 10.00.00] Ems : Yousif this isn't helping I literally wanted to go for a nice walk and she was barely talking to me for hours
[25/07/2025, 10.00.01] Ems : So
[25/07/2025, 10.00.02] Yousif Zaid: The hat thing is ridiculous
[25/07/2025, 10.00.24] Yousif Zaid: No I know the nature of your relationship is different from mine and my brothers
[25/07/2025, 10.01.16] Yousif Zaid: Within the Marta/emma context I think you’re in the right I just wish my brother was a bit more eager to spend time with me
[25/07/2025, 10.01.41] Ems : They are all different it was annoying but I get what you mean
[25/07/2025, 10.02.11] Yousif Zaid: The hat thing is absolutely ridiculous you brought the hat to the trip didn’t you
[25/07/2025, 10.02.11] Ems : Honestly it's only been recently that we've started actually hanging out
[25/07/2025, 10.02.27] Ems : I did in my fucking little backpack
[25/07/2025, 10.02.32] Yousif Zaid: Ahhahahahahahha
[25/07/2025, 10.02.38] Yousif Zaid: Is it a cool hat
[25/07/2025, 10.02.44] Ems : The coolest
[25/07/2025, 10.02.49] Ems : Also I have terrible news
[25/07/2025, 10.02.52] Yousif Zaid: Let me see
[25/07/2025, 10.02.56] Ems : Catastrophic
[25/07/2025, 10.03.19] Ems : I'll send you a picture later I'm reading on the front of the boat now
[25/07/2025, 10.03.25] Ems : You know my glasses?
[25/07/2025, 10.03.32] Ems : The ones I always wear
[25/07/2025, 10.03.54] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[25/07/2025, 10.04.11] Ems : Yesterday the sea was rough I think they are somewhere at the bottom of the sea in Ithaca right now
[25/07/2025, 10.04.15] Ems : Yes
[25/07/2025, 10.04.28] Yousif Zaid: In a way that’s a bit romantic isn’t it?
[25/07/2025, 10.04.47] Ems : If we want to be positive about it yes
[25/07/2025, 10.04.49] Ems : Very
[25/07/2025, 10.05.03] Yousif Zaid: Most glasses end up in people’s bedside drawers forgotten
[25/07/2025, 10.05.25] Ems : It wasn't their time yet
[25/07/2025, 10.05.31] Ems : But it is a good way to go
[25/07/2025, 10.05.34] Ems : You're right
[25/07/2025, 10.05.40] Ems : This put things into perspective
[25/07/2025, 10.05.43] Yousif Zaid: Yours? Resting among the

[25/07/2025, 10.10.08] Ems : He's probably looking awesome with the glasses though

[25/07/2025, 10.10.47] Ems : The helmet completes the look
[25/07/2025, 10.13.14] Yousif Zaid: Now you get to go through the joys of buying new sunglasses
[25/07/2025, 10.39.27] Ems : I will ask for advice

[25/07/2025, 11.04.12] Yousif Zaid: I’ll introduce you one day but I mean
[25/07/2025, 11.04.25] Yousif Zaid: I just can’t fucking believe my eyes
[25/07/2025, 11.04.43] Ems : How long is your CV?
[25/07/2025, 11.04.51] Yousif Zaid: It’s one page long as it should be
[25/07/2025, 11.05.02] Ems : Ok thank god I was questioning mine
[25/07/2025, 11.05.04] Yousif Zaid: There’s no color on it, no photo of me
[25/07/2025, 11.05.27] Yousif Zaid: I don’t specify that I’m a male
[25/07/2025, 11.05.30] Ems : You should put a photo
[25/07/2025, 11.05.46] Ems : Or some colour
[25/07/2025, 11.06.05] Yousif Zaid: Putting a photo of my very Arabic face does not do me any favours in Denmark unfortunately
[25/07/2025, 11.06.11] Ems : Don't be mysterious in your CV it's not the place
[25/07/2025, 11.06.44] Yousif Zaid: It literally is the only place to be professional. I show up to the interview I make jokes and I’m light hearted but I think CVs should be very conservative
[25/07/2025, 11.06.46] Ems : The danish might take you on just for that wdym
[25/07/2025, 11.07.09] Yousif Zaid: You deleted this message.
[25/07/2025, 11.08.38] Yousif Zaid: “Preparing foccacias (Italian panini)”

[25/07/2025, 14.00.53] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHA you're mean
[25/07/2025, 14.01.26] Ems : I had to get creative because I don't have much work experience
[25/07/2025, 14.11.19] Yousif Zaid: No I know. I feel guilty not paranoid
[25/07/2025, 14.11.47] Yousif Zaid: “Refilling ingredients and beverages”
[25/07/2025, 14.12.30] Yousif Zaid: This one is under his “beach service” job:
“Waiter (also at beach)
[25/07/2025, 14.12.55] Yousif Zaid: John said it would be helpful if they ever got a sand castle in their offices
[25/07/2025, 14.13.31] Yousif Zaid: That’s fair enough I don’t know what I would do actually if I didn’t have work experience
[25/07/2025, 14.14.44] Yousif Zaid: Like brother you have it listed under your beach service job why do you have to add that you were still at the beach as a waiter
[25/07/2025, 14.15.14] Yousif Zaid: Bartender:
“Collecting glasses and washing them”
[25/07/2025, 14.16.20] Yousif Zaid: Well I’m glad he collected them before washing them, and did those things in that order [25/07/2025, 14.16.27] Yousif Zaid: I’m a terrible fucking person emma
[25/07/2025, 14.23.27] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
[25/07/2025, 14.23.47] Ems : I'm laughing out loud every time you quote it I kid you not
[25/07/2025, 14.24.10] Ems : This is extreme
[25/07/2025, 14.24.13] Ems : Actually

[25/07/2025, 17.28.57] Ems : THAT'S AN INDIAN ACCENT
[25/07/2025, 17.29.10] Ems : It's because of the red dot I believe
[25/07/2025, 17.29.20] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[25/07/2025, 17.29.40] Yousif Zaid: I received a membership card and a pamphlet in the mail welcoming me to the club
[25/07/2025, 17.29.57] Yousif Zaid: It also said to immediately ask you out that was pretty weird
[25/07/2025, 17.30.04] Ems : You'll forever speak Indian now
[25/07/2025, 17.30.09] Ems : That explains a lot

[25/07/2025, 17.40.48] Ems : It must've been sunny recently right?
[25/07/2025, 17.51.27] Yousif Zaid: Nope. Dad just walked onto the yard with his book and went “you’re not better than me!” And sat down and started reading too
[25/07/2025, 18.08.12] Yousif Zaid: Yoooooo this murakami guy is a weirdo
[25/07/2025, 18.56.23] Ems : That is actually really cute
[25/07/2025, 18.56.40] Ems : See the problem is that I don't even know which part you're talking about
[25/07/2025, 18.57.41] Yousif Zaid: 13 year old lesbian
[25/07/2025, 19.28.32] Ems : Oh fuck that was something
[25/07/2025, 19.28.49] Ems : Btw I started blood meridian today after lunch
[25/07/2025, 19.28.57] Ems : I'm on page 55 I think
[25/07/2025, 19.29.05] Yousif Zaid: Have you been introduced to the judge?
[25/07/2025, 19.29.10] Ems : I'm really enjoying it
[25/07/2025, 19.29.13] Ems : Yes just
[25/07/2025, 19.29.21] Ems : When he got that reverend killed
[25/07/2025, 19.29.26] Yousif Zaid: One of the more memorable intros of any character I’ve seen
[25/07/2025, 19.29.34] Yousif Zaid: So fucking weird right?
[25/07/2025, 19.29.42] Ems : The plot twist was crazy
[25/07/2025, 19.29.44] Yousif Zaid: Just lying about a reverend being a nonce or whatever
[25/07/2025, 19.30.06] Ems : Also I had imagined the kid differently when you talked about him
[25/07/2025, 19.30.14] Ems : He's such an interesting character
[25/07/2025, 19.30.40] Yousif Zaid: How so?
[25/07/2025, 19.32.42] Ems : When you say kid you think innocence right
[25/07/2025, 19.32.48] Ems : It's so different
[25/07/2025, 19.33.06] Yousif Zaid: I think he’s just named that to underline how much of an orphan he is [25/07/2025, 19.33.09] Yousif Zaid: He’s never given a name
[25/07/2025, 19.33.40] Yousif Zaid: You can choose to think of the kid in any way you want, that’s what I like about the book so much
[25/07/2025, 19.33.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s up to you
[25/07/2025, 19.35.18] Yousif Zaid: The lack of punctuation and quotation marks isn’t bothering you?
[25/07/2025, 19.41.41] Ems : Yeah I do get it now
[25/07/2025, 19.42.02] Ems : It kind of gives rhythm to the book doesn't it?
[25/07/2025, 19.42.20] Yousif Zaid: It takes a bit of getting used to but it makes it flow better
[25/07/2025, 19.42.38] Yousif Zaid: Like there’s no “okay this is narrator” or “okay now it’s a character”
[25/07/2025, 19.42.43] Yousif Zaid: It’s just a flow of words
[25/07/2025, 19.44.25] Ems : Exactly
[25/07/2025, 19.44.41] Ems : It's not been THAT violent yet but I'm expecting it from the pace
[25/07/2025, 19.44.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m kind of jealous of you I wish I could read it for the first time
[25/07/2025, 19.44.56] Ems : He's joined the captain
[25/07/2025, 19.45.01] Yousif Zaid: I always liked his and toadvines first interaction
[25/07/2025, 19.45.25] Yousif Zaid: They just meet and they’re threatening to split each others heads open. Honestly what is their problem
[25/07/2025, 19.45.47] Yousif Zaid: Glanton?
[25/07/2025, 19.46.16] Ems : White I think
[25/07/2025, 19.46.32] Yousif Zaid: Captain white! Ahhh
[25/07/2025, 19.46.37] Yousif Zaid: Ahahahhahahahahah okay
[25/07/2025, 20.19.13] Ems : I just read " he saw men caught by the hair and scalped standing"
[25/07/2025, 20.19.32] Ems : image omitted
[25/07/2025, 20.19.35] Ems : It feels wrong
[25/07/2025, 20.19.42] Yousif Zaid: I fucking told you
[25/07/2025, 20.19.52] Yousif Zaid: “I’m gonna read blood meridian on a family cruise :)”
[25/07/2025, 20.20.06] Yousif Zaid: It’s like eating bread pudding watching a brain surgery
[25/07/2025, 20.20.16] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAH
[25/07/2025, 20.20.30] Ems : Exactly
[25/07/2025, 20.20.32] Ems : Oh well
[25/07/2025, 20.20.38] Ems : Too late now
[25/07/2025, 20.20.44] Yousif Zaid: What’s the context I wanna know where you’re at
[25/07/2025, 20.20.59] Yousif Zaid: Also felt wrong to read about a 13 year old and a 31 year old
[25/07/2025, 20.21.11] Yousif Zaid: And how the 31 year old liked it
[25/07/2025, 20.21.20] Ems : It's the first time they have a battle while they're crossing the desert
[25/07/2025, 20.21.33] Yousif Zaid: See this is why I
[25/07/2025, 20.21.38] Ems : I feel like they haven't introduced why they scalp the people but ok
[25/07/2025, 20.21.40] Yousif Zaid: Reacted this way
[25/07/2025, 20.21.48] Ems : I was wondering
[25/07/2025, 20.21.54] Yousif Zaid: They immediately get fucked
[25/07/2025, 20.22.00] Ems : Yeah...
[25/07/2025, 20.22.07] Ems : WAIT SHUT UP
[25/07/2025, 20.22.14] Ems : I haven't finished the battle
[25/07/2025, 20.22.22] Yousif Zaid: You’re reading about them getting fucked aren’t you?
[25/07/2025, 20.22.33] Ems : Yes but just barely
[25/07/2025, 20.22.35] Yousif Zaid: Wouldn’t you say getting scalped is getting fucked
[25/07/2025, 20.22.38] Yousif Zaid: It’s not a spoiler
[25/07/2025, 20.22.49] Ems : True
[25/07/2025, 20.23.28] Yousif Zaid: That’s historical
[25/07/2025, 20.23.44] Yousif Zaid: I think people started doing it just to scare the shit out of the enemy
[25/07/2025, 20.24.00] Yousif Zaid: Also to collect bounties
[25/07/2025, 20.24.06] Yousif Zaid: “Kill emma for 100 dollars”
[25/07/2025, 20.24.15] Yousif Zaid: “Well here is her scalp and lovely hair where is my money”
[25/07/2025, 20.24.17] Ems : But you said an Indian's scalp is worth more because tattoos right?
[25/07/2025, 20.24.18] Yousif Zaid: That type of thing
[25/07/2025, 20.24.31] Ems : Or 79 camels
[25/07/2025, 20.24.37] Yousif Zaid: You get it!
[25/07/2025, 20.24.53] Yousif Zaid: I think it was something like “well here’s proof it was an Indian scalp cuz of tattoos”
[25/07/2025, 20.25.03] Yousif Zaid: I could have been lying it sounds like something I’d do
[25/07/2025, 20.25.39] Ems : Ok cool
[25/07/2025, 21.01.54] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[25/07/2025, 21.02.45] Yousif Zaid: emma leone i'm about to start crying tears of joy
[25/07/2025, 21.03.07] Yousif Zaid: it's like being reunited with a long lost sibling
[25/07/2025, 21.06.29] Ems : Ohhh put a slice of lime in there
[25/07/2025, 21.06.33] Ems : What's the occasion?
[25/07/2025, 21.06.39] Yousif Zaid: i just felt like it :)
[25/07/2025, 21.07.18] Yousif Zaid: currently sipping on sparkling water while i do nerd shit but when i'm done; ice cold corona with lime and i read before bed. i'm so excited
[25/07/2025, 21.08.09] Ems : That sounds like a great plan
[25/07/2025, 21.08.10] Ems : Wow
[25/07/2025, 21.08.31] Ems : I'm just having chocolate and wine with the fam
[25/07/2025, 21.08.38] Yousif Zaid: johns daughter is starting to mumble "joseph!" when i come to visit
[25/07/2025, 21.08.49] Ems : Awwww
[25/07/2025, 21.08.51] Ems : So cute
[25/07/2025, 21.09.03] Yousif Zaid: that sounds lovely, enjoy. i'll do my nerd shit
[25/07/2025, 21.11.36] Ems : A Corona in your future will keep you very focused
[25/07/2025, 21.11.57] Yousif Zaid: salivating at the thought (i'm an alcoholic)
[25/07/2025, 21.39.52] Ems : I think you're just a lightweight
[25/07/2025, 21.40.15] Yousif Zaid: both can be true

[26/07/2025, 02.25.25] Yousif Zaid: Yeah it’s done and my chest hurts a little bit. I’m going to bed
[26/07/2025, 02.46.40] Yousif Zaid: Man fuck murakami and that dumbass beard of his
[26/07/2025, 06.19.19] Ems : HAHAHAHAJAHAHAJ
[26/07/2025, 06.19.26] Ems : Love João
[26/07/2025, 06.20.05] Ems : I'm crying because why does this look like the most enjoyable evening ever
[26/07/2025, 06.20.35] Ems : You read that so quick
[26/07/2025, 06.20.38] Ems : So?????
[26/07/2025, 06.20.43] Ems : Thoughts
[26/07/2025, 09.58.55] Yousif Zaid: I think the entire book was about his struggle to overcome the grief and savior complex and emotional numbness that stem from Kizou’s suicide
[26/07/2025, 09.59.35] Yousif Zaid: He sleeps with strangers because just holding someone is the only human contact he gets
[26/07/2025, 10.01.31] Yousif Zaid: He tries his best to sort of snap out of it and try to lead a happy life with Midori, but just completely falls apart the second reiko leaves for ahinasaki and probably becomes even more mentally ill than naoko
[26/07/2025, 10.02.27] Yousif Zaid: Btw I have have reason to believe reiko is gonna kill herself in ahinasaki as well
[26/07/2025, 10.03.01] Yousif Zaid: It’s a very very depressing but beautiful, sometimes creepy (murakami is a sexual deviant) book
[26/07/2025, 10.03.48] Yousif Zaid: Terrible ending. For a second I thought he’d be fine but that phone call with midori convinced me he was fucked for life
[26/07/2025, 10.04.54] Yousif Zaid: That’s my 3rd grade analysis
[26/07/2025, 10.49.52] Yousif Zaid: It actually really reminds me of the movie “Manchester by the Sea”
[26/07/2025, 12.50.47] Ems : I agree with most of it but I disagree about the ending
[26/07/2025, 12.50.57] Ems : I think the final line is really on point
[26/07/2025, 12.51.35] Ems : I remember my favourite scene really convinced me of how nice the book was
[26/07/2025, 12.51.43] Ems : Naoko's funeral
[26/07/2025, 12.51.49] Ems : The one with the songs
[26/07/2025, 12.51.51] Yousif Zaid: With the 50 songs
[26/07/2025, 12.51.55] Ems : Yes
[26/07/2025, 12.52.08] Yousif Zaid: What do you think that phone call is about
[26/07/2025, 12.53.06] Ems : I think it's still him being lost, that's why he asks her where are you now
[26/07/2025, 12.53.23] Ems : It's murakami saying he still doesn't know anything
[26/07/2025, 12.53.26] Ems : I think
[26/07/2025, 12.53.35] Yousif Zaid: She asks him that
[26/07/2025, 12.53.46] Yousif Zaid: And he seems to start dissociating real hard
[26/07/2025, 12.54.15] Yousif Zaid: But that doesn’t make you wrong he literally can’t answer that simple question
[26/07/2025, 12.54.36] Ems : Yeah I got confused but the thought was that
[26/07/2025, 12.54.40] Ems : I remembered thinking it
[26/07/2025, 12.55.04] Yousif Zaid: Reiko is very sweet
[26/07/2025, 12.55.07] Ems : I really really disliked her though
[26/07/2025, 12.55.12] Ems : Mmh
[26/07/2025, 12.55.13] Ems : Ok
[26/07/2025, 12.55.14] Yousif Zaid: Midori?
[26/07/2025, 12.55.20] Ems : Yeah
[26/07/2025, 12.55.23] Ems : I love reiki
[26/07/2025, 12.55.24] Ems : O
[26/07/2025, 12.55.39] Ems : She's my favourite
[26/07/2025, 12.55.42] Yousif Zaid: Midori was a nothing-burger character
[26/07/2025, 12.56.19] Ems : I kind of hated Midori i feel like when they say murakami is sexist that's what they're talking about
[26/07/2025, 12.57.08] Ems : Like sometimes I read a female character's thoughts and they could be mine, Midori Is Just what people expect women to think
[26/07/2025, 12.57.15] Ems : So badly written
[26/07/2025, 12.57.28] Ems : Reiko is amazing though
[26/07/2025, 12.57.44] Yousif Zaid: If I ever find myself thinking “yeah this girl probably thinks like Midori” I would immediately leave the area
[26/07/2025, 12.58.51] Yousif Zaid: She’s like a caricature. Like a bunch of 40s businessmen sat down and were like “okay let’s write a character”
[26/07/2025, 12.59.31] Ems : Immediately
[26/07/2025, 12.59.40] Ems : Yes this is what I'm talking about
[26/07/2025, 12.59.52] Ems : But I do think it's a very beautiful book
[26/07/2025, 13.00.09] Ems : You just get into the thoughts so much and there's barely a plot
[26/07/2025, 13.00.15] Yousif Zaid: I really did like it
[26/07/2025, 13.00.16] Ems : I think that makes it special
[26/07/2025, 13.00.26] Yousif Zaid: “I went out for lunch Somebody jerked me off I went home drank and read ” [26/07/2025, 13.00.50] Yousif Zaid: That’s most of the concrete plot anyhow, but the thoughts are there, you’re right
[26/07/2025, 13.02.28] Yousif Zaid: The bit about spring breaking out in his new flat and how the cherry blossoms looked like flesh was very pretty
[26/07/2025, 13.06.58] Ems : True
[26/07/2025, 13.07.24] Ems : I honestly liked it, during the time in the mental hospital I was glued to the book
[26/07/2025, 13.07.42] Yousif Zaid: Yes exactly it was the highlight for me I think
[26/07/2025, 13.07.52] Ems : But every time Midori talked i rolled my eyes
[26/07/2025, 13.08.04] Yousif Zaid: Yo why the fuck did she get naked infront of her dads shrine
[26/07/2025, 13.08.10] Ems : Like at the porn movie
[26/07/2025, 13.08.14] Ems : No like
[26/07/2025, 13.08.34] Ems : I was so so done with her
[26/07/2025, 13.08.54] Yousif Zaid: I get that she’s supposed to be Naokos opposite right
[26/07/2025, 13.09.22] Yousif Zaid: So open and communicative and also sex positive
[26/07/2025, 13.10.02] Yousif Zaid: But I feel like she’d have been made a better prospect as “the future woman” if she was just less perverted
[26/07/2025, 13.10.11] Yousif Zaid: Or whatever the fuck
[26/07/2025, 13.10.41] Ems : Yeah but I think the reason that naoko feels better written is because since she's uncommunicative she's open to interpretation
[26/07/2025, 13.10.50] Ems : For the reader
[26/07/2025, 13.11.25] Yousif Zaid: You’re really gonna like the kid
[26/07/2025, 13.15.28] Ems : I'm not saying that characters that don't communicate are better, just that in contrast to Midori naoko feels like she could actually exist
[26/07/2025, 13.15.34] Ems : But I think I will like the kid
[26/07/2025, 13.15.39] Ems : He keeps surprising me
[26/07/2025, 13.17.49] Yousif Zaid: Yeah murakami really fucked up the whole “open and honest” woman character, at least in his case
[26/07/2025, 13.18.30] Yousif Zaid: Reiko for example is open and honest and communicates and doesn’t have issues with sex and her character doesn’t come off as one dimensional and cringy
[26/07/2025, 13.19.20] Yousif Zaid: She’s a more effective “ opposite naoko”
[26/07/2025, 15.13.16] Ems : True
[26/07/2025, 15.17.04] Ems : There's been a change of plans we're going back to Italy tonight
[26/07/2025, 15.17.15] Ems : So we're currently heading to the airport
[26/07/2025, 15.17.22] Ems : Oh I found my glasses btw
[26/07/2025, 15.17.26] Ems : I was so happy
[26/07/2025, 15.18.17] Yousif Zaid: Oh what why?
[26/07/2025, 15.18.35] Yousif Zaid: They’re not in the bottom of the Greek peninsula? I’m happy for you but almost a little dissatisfied also
[26/07/2025, 15.19.16] Ems : Grandma is sick
[26/07/2025, 15.19.25] Ems : I wear the better than Ajax anyway
[26/07/2025, 15.19.36] Yousif Zaid: Oh I’m sorry to hear that. What’s troubling her? If you don’t mind my prying
[26/07/2025, 15.25.44] Ems : She got sick a few weeks ago but it got worse
[26/07/2025, 15.25.52] Ems : Wendy and Ella will be happy to see us
[26/07/2025, 15.26.29] Yousif Zaid: Just tell me to fuck off if it’s not my place but keep me updated, I’m sorry
[26/07/2025, 15.26.49] Yousif Zaid: That’s always nice. I wish I had a pet. Maybe a cat or something
[26/07/2025, 15.27.08] Ems : I literally told you out of the blue why would I tell you to fuck off
[26/07/2025, 15.27.14] Ems : Don't be daft
[26/07/2025, 15.27.21] Yousif Zaid: Sorry ma’am
[26/07/2025, 15.27.26] Ems : Wait are you a cat person
[26/07/2025, 15.27.38] Yousif Zaid: I love both. Cats are perhaps easier to manage
[26/07/2025, 15.35.40] Ems : Ok I was going to block you
[26/07/2025, 15.35.58] Yousif Zaid: I just don’t understand cat hate
[26/07/2025, 15.36.00] Yousif Zaid: Is all
[26/07/2025, 15.36.13] Yousif Zaid: The whole myth about how they don’t care about their owner is bullshit
[26/07/2025, 15.54.52] Yousif Zaid: So you’re no longer interested in new glasses?
[26/07/2025, 16.37.48] Ems : If I see a really cool pair somewhere I will get them
[26/07/2025, 16.38.12] Ems : Idk they don't convince me
[26/07/2025, 16.38.20] Yousif Zaid: I’m at home and I’ve already been to the gym and I’ve finished my books I have literally nothing to do
[26/07/2025, 16.38.24] Yousif Zaid: Any ideas?
[26/07/2025, 16.38.32] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[26/07/2025, 16.45.49] Ems : Either you bake something really difficult
[26/07/2025, 16.45.57] Ems : Or I like to paint sometimes
[26/07/2025, 16.46.12] Ems : Exception to the rule
[26/07/2025, 16.47.31] Yousif Zaid: Painting. Hmmm
[26/07/2025, 16.47.53] Yousif Zaid: What do I paint
[26/07/2025, 16.48.54] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[26/07/2025, 16.50.21] Yousif Zaid: I can’t even find my paints
[26/07/2025, 16.52.55] Yousif Zaid: Are these cool?
[26/07/2025, 16.53.24] Yousif Zaid: ?
[26/07/2025, 17.03.31] Yousif Zaid: Okay I’ve decided to draw instead
[26/07/2025, 17.27.55] Ems : Nooo why would you
[26/07/2025, 17.28.03] Ems : They're awesome
[26/07/2025, 17.28.07] Ems : Send pictures
[26/07/2025, 17.28.10] Yousif Zaid: I don’t care about it
[26/07/2025, 17.28.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[26/07/2025, 17.28.23] Yousif Zaid: Here’s the subject
[26/07/2025, 17.28.38] Ems : I have lots of silly paintings in my room just keep it
[26/07/2025, 17.28.50] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t even paint this one
[26/07/2025, 17.28.57] Ems : Very nice, is the Corona included?
[26/07/2025, 17.29.03] Yousif Zaid: It doesn’t matter I couldn’t find my paints I’m doing a pencil sketch
[26/07/2025, 17.29.12] Yousif Zaid: No im drinking it too fast to use it as a subject
[26/07/2025, 17.29.14] Ems : Ohh you told me
[26/07/2025, 17.29.34] Ems : Empty bottle is very poetic
[26/07/2025, 17.30.02] Yousif Zaid: Yk what you’re right. Including it at the end as a doodle
[26/07/2025, 17.30.13] Ems : I want to see how you do when you don't have a little french girl judging you
[26/07/2025, 17.30.25] Yousif Zaid: Terribly
[26/07/2025, 17.30.29] Yousif Zaid: Especially when I’m drinking
[26/07/2025, 17.30.35] Yousif Zaid: I’ve never been so bored I just start drawing
[26/07/2025, 17.31.18] Ems : I think it's so fun sometimes
[26/07/2025, 17.31.28] Ems : Listen if it's bad you just call it abstract
[26/07/2025, 17.31.43] Yousif Zaid: But I want to be good at everything
[26/07/2025, 17.31.46] Yousif Zaid: A renaissance man
[26/07/2025, 17.33.05] Ems : Byronian
[26/07/2025, 17.34.38] Yousif Zaid: I read darkness again the other night it was very good
[26/07/2025, 17.38.54] Ems : I'll have to read it I don't think I've ever read it fully
[26/07/2025, 17.39.04] Ems : Wait I'll show you something cool
[26/07/2025, 17.39.17] Ems : image omitted
[26/07/2025, 17.39.33] Ems : It was too nice not to take a picture
[26/07/2025, 17.41.18] Yousif Zaid: The sun blends onto the cover very well
[26/07/2025, 17.52.19] Ems : Right
[26/07/2025, 19.23.50] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[26/07/2025, 19.29.45] Yousif Zaid: I really love corona
[26/07/2025, 20.40.17] Ems : This is so cool yuyu
[26/07/2025, 20.40.25] Ems : Flowers are top tier
[26/07/2025, 20.41.17] Ems : Corona is also really well done, you should start designing beer bottles for companies
[26/07/2025, 20.41.33] Yousif Zaid: I think I’d get in trouble for false advertisement
[26/07/2025, 20.41.39] Yousif Zaid: Are you guys about to fly?
[26/07/2025, 20.42.13] Ems : I don't know it kind of tracks
[26/07/2025, 20.42.20] Yousif Zaid: It really does
[26/07/2025, 20.42.23] Ems : Flight leaves in an hour
[26/07/2025, 20.42.35] Yousif Zaid: But we can’t prove that the first sip of a corona is like your first kiss
[26/07/2025, 20.42.42] Yousif Zaid: So we will get sued
[26/07/2025, 20.42.56] Ems : We had dinner on the airport floor
[26/07/2025, 20.43.08] Yousif Zaid: I hope you guys didn’t get your boat time cut too short, when were you supposed to go back originally?
[26/07/2025, 20.43.38] Ems : I feel like the person suing would just be a loser
[26/07/2025, 20.43.53] Ems : 2nd of August but then albania
[26/07/2025, 20.44.09] Ems : I don't know what's going to happen tbh
[26/07/2025, 20.44.17] Yousif Zaid: Are you worried?
[26/07/2025, 20.44.44] Ems : To be honest we got bad news at about 4 pm
[26/07/2025, 20.44.53] Ems : So not it's just aftermaths
[26/07/2025, 20.44.56] Ems : Now*
[26/07/2025, 20.45.30] Yousif Zaid: I’m sorry to hear that. I hope it’s nothing too bad. She’s the one that lives with you in Rome yes?
[26/07/2025, 20.46.00] Yousif Zaid: The one I saw that photo of?
[26/07/2025, 20.47.36] Ems : No I mean she passed away, she wasn't the one living with us, it was my dad's mom
[26/07/2025, 20.47.45] Ems : Now we're just waiting for the plane
[26/07/2025, 20.52.04] Yousif Zaid: I’m at a loss for something “good” to say. I’m really sorry. Are you doing okay? Want me to stop with the texting for a bit or? Not sure I have anything of value to say but if you want to talk I’m there. Or not. Whatever works
[26/07/2025, 20.55.28] Ems : I'm really tired and obviously a bit sad but I'll be fine please don't be weird hahahahaha
[26/07/2025, 20.55.53] Ems : It's ok I didn't tell you to make you feel sorry just to let you know
[26/07/2025, 20.56.31] Yousif Zaid: Man I don’t fucking know
[26/07/2025, 20.56.48] Yousif Zaid: Someone’s grandparent passes you don’t know how they react
[26/07/2025, 20.57.05] Yousif Zaid: Mine died 2 years ago and I just remember being worried for my father cuz I wasn’t close to the dude at all
[26/07/2025, 20.57.20] Yousif Zaid: So I figured better safe than sorry, no more weirdness now
[26/07/2025, 20.59.48] Ems : No I was quite close to her but no weirdness necessary
[26/07/2025, 21.00.17] Ems : Right now I'm hating every greek on the planet because why is this the fullest airport I've ever been in
[26/07/2025, 21.00.42] Yousif Zaid: You know for a second I thought about being insensitive and just replying “airports suck huh” as a joke
[26/07/2025, 21.00.54] Yousif Zaid: Now I’m kind of wishing I had
[26/07/2025, 21.01.05] Ems : I repeat, I random stuff on the floor for dinner because there wasn't a single sea
[26/07/2025, 21.01.12] Ems : You should've
[26/07/2025, 21.01.17] Ems : I would've laughed
[26/07/2025, 21.01.34] Yousif Zaid: “Grandma passed we’re flying home”
“Airports am I right?”
[26/07/2025, 21.01.37] Yousif Zaid: Sick
[26/07/2025, 21.01.38] Ems : I forgot about three words in this sentence I'm so tired
[26/07/2025, 21.02.07] Ems : There was 50/50 chance of me laughing or me not talking to you ever again
[26/07/2025, 21.02.11] Yousif Zaid: I understood
[26/07/2025, 21.02.18] Yousif Zaid: Yeah!
[26/07/2025, 21.02.22] Yousif Zaid: ^^^
[26/07/2025, 21.02.48] Ems : !!
[26/07/2025, 21.03.10] Yousif Zaid: I once did a 20 hour layover in Athens airport and I left hating Greeks
[26/07/2025, 21.04.16] Yousif Zaid: And I’m currently dressed like a clown going for a walk
[26/07/2025, 21.07.19] Ems : What's being dressed like a clown?
[26/07/2025, 21.08.18] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[26/07/2025, 21.08.50] Yousif Zaid: Lady infront of me in line was buying cheap slices of ham and cigarettes I wanted to give her a hug
[26/07/2025, 21.10.45] Ems : I've never seen you wear a single one of these items
[26/07/2025, 21.10.58] Ems : That sounds like something I would do
[26/07/2025, 21.11.13] Yousif Zaid: Telling you it’s a clown show
[27/07/2025, 06.48.41] Ems : image omitted
[27/07/2025, 06.49.02] Ems : We got home at like 3 in the end
[27/07/2025, 10.35.12] Yousif Zaid: You know I saw the notification and that there was a photo and I was expecting a photo of Wendy and Ella
[27/07/2025, 10.37.51] Yousif Zaid: This is lovely too
[27/07/2025, 14.02.28] Ems : Oh they were so happy
[27/07/2025, 14.07.44] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 14.07.58] Yousif Zaid: Have nothing to do and nobody to chill with so we’re out for a run
[27/07/2025, 14.08.37] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 14.15.46] Ems : Is this near your house
[27/07/2025, 14.15.51] Ems : It's so beautiful
[27/07/2025, 14.16.06] Yousif Zaid: Yes, it’s the forest we used to go drinking in during lockdown
[27/07/2025, 14.16.27] Ems : What's this bird called I forget
[27/07/2025, 14.16.40] Yousif Zaid: I’m not a bird man but it’s like a shitty stork don’t you think?
[27/07/2025, 14.16.41] Ems : Hahahahahahaha it's always the drinking spots
[27/07/2025, 14.16.56] Ems : I'll look it up
[27/07/2025, 14.17.02] Yousif Zaid: A swallow?
[27/07/2025, 14.17.09] Ems : I'll Google lens it
[27/07/2025, 14.17.13] Yousif Zaid: Heron!
[27/07/2025, 14.17.18] Yousif Zaid: A grey heron I bet
[27/07/2025, 14.17.27] Yousif Zaid: Studio ghibli did a movie with one recently
[27/07/2025, 14.17.42] Ems : image omitted
[27/07/2025, 14.17.51] Ems : You are a bird man look at that
[27/07/2025, 14.17.55] Ems : Did you look it up?
[27/07/2025, 14.18.03] Yousif Zaid: No
[27/07/2025, 14.18.07] Yousif Zaid: Omg there’s bird watchers here
[27/07/2025, 14.18.16] Ems : See I don't know if I believe you
[27/07/2025, 14.18.30] Yousif Zaid: It was on the tip of my tongue
[27/07/2025, 14.18.33] Yousif Zaid: The boy and the heron
[27/07/2025, 14.18.49] Yousif Zaid: They look like virgins
[27/07/2025, 14.18.56] Ems : HAHAHAJAHHAHAHAH
[27/07/2025, 14.19.01] Ems : Go tell them that
[27/07/2025, 14.19.10] Ems : Just ran past them and say it
[27/07/2025, 14.19.13] Yousif Zaid: Camouflage on the camera lens. Give me a fucking break man I’m dressed in trainers and the birds see me and don’t run away
[27/07/2025, 14.19.15] Ems : Run
[27/07/2025, 14.19.43] Yousif Zaid: You know how mad I’d be if someone ran past me just going “virgin!”
[27/07/2025, 14.19.44] Ems : Camouflage in a park is quite funny
[27/07/2025, 14.20.09] Ems : Exactly, it would give you more motivation to run fast
[27/07/2025, 14.20.15] Yousif Zaid: I have a problem. I got a 10 beers in the fridge
[27/07/2025, 14.20.26] Yousif Zaid: But if I have more than 1 a day my dad will judge me
[27/07/2025, 14.20.34] Yousif Zaid: He’s like “why don’t you do anything it’s summer”
[27/07/2025, 14.20.43] Yousif Zaid: I wanna sit in this park and drink all 10 but I can’t say that to him
[27/07/2025, 14.21.18] Ems : What you do is you buy more and every time you want a cold beer you substitute it
[27/07/2025, 14.21.31] Yousif Zaid: You’re actually brilliant
[27/07/2025, 14.21.32] Ems : Shit I would love to be there
[27/07/2025, 14.21.35] Ems : Right
[27/07/2025, 14.21.47] Yousif Zaid: Look. September is still warm right
[27/07/2025, 14.22.02] Yousif Zaid: The stakes are low the semester isn’t hard yet
[27/07/2025, 14.22.10] Yousif Zaid: I say we just do it then
[27/07/2025, 14.22.34] Ems : Very true
[27/07/2025, 14.22.36] Ems : Agree
[27/07/2025, 14.22.49] Yousif Zaid: We also gotta go to Louisiana
[27/07/2025, 14.22.55] Ems : But by then your tolerance might be too high for me to keep up
[27/07/2025, 14.23.11] Yousif Zaid: Im a lightweight remember
[27/07/2025, 14.23.19] Yousif Zaid: You’re half my size and can drink me under the table
[27/07/2025, 14.25.03] Ems : Yeah I got this
[27/07/2025, 14.25.12] Ems : Now maybe we can drink the same amount then
[27/07/2025, 14.25.23] Yousif Zaid: I never forget the pink bucket
[27/07/2025, 14.25.55] Ems : I never forget the very clearly drunk look you get
[27/07/2025, 14.26.07] Yousif Zaid: Let me look for an example
[27/07/2025, 14.27.46] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 14.27.52] Yousif Zaid: Oh this was bad
[27/07/2025, 14.28.16] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 14.29.34] Yousif Zaid: it’s a blink or two and a stare where my eyes aren’t exactly pointing in the right direction
[27/07/2025, 14.30.32] Ems : This is giving me flashbacks
[27/07/2025, 14.30.39] Ems : Exactly
[27/07/2025, 14.30.55] Yousif Zaid: You just get bolder
[27/07/2025, 14.30.59] Yousif Zaid: Same personality just more
[27/07/2025, 14.31.08] Ems : Wow
[27/07/2025, 14.31.15] Ems : That's something
[27/07/2025, 14.31.23] Ems : More white girlness
[27/07/2025, 14.31.34] Yousif Zaid: You just start antagonising guys twice my size
[27/07/2025, 14.31.39] Yousif Zaid: It’s horrifying
[27/07/2025, 14.31.59] Ems : Wait no I don't
[27/07/2025, 14.32.21] Ems : It's just that drunk guys are sometimes really annoying
[27/07/2025, 14.32.28] Yousif Zaid: In the distortion tunnel you straight up shoved a guy and I immediately went
[27/07/2025, 14.32.35] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 14.32.43] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAJ
[27/07/2025, 14.33.04] Yousif Zaid: Like he’s not gonna hit YOU
[27/07/2025, 14.33.04] Ems : It was probably deserved
[27/07/2025, 14.33.21] Ems : Exactly which is why I can shove him
[27/07/2025, 14.33.34] Ems : He wouldn't hit you either what did you do
[27/07/2025, 14.33.49] Yousif Zaid: Okay and what happens when he decides to give Soheyl facial reconstruction surgery just because he’s standing near you
[27/07/2025, 14.34.21] Ems : I believe drunk me didn't think that far ahead
[27/07/2025, 14.34.37] Yousif Zaid: You never shove a dude I can fight either
[27/07/2025, 14.34.51] Yousif Zaid: It’s always Boris from Transylvania who grew up bare knuckle boxing
[27/07/2025, 14.35.42] Ems : You're talking about this like it's a recurring thing
[27/07/2025, 14.35.54] Ems : The distortion tunnel was just crowded
[27/07/2025, 14.36.08] Ems : I have a very clear image of him in my head
[27/07/2025, 14.40.00] Yousif Zaid: The shoving thing was a one time thing I grant you
[27/07/2025, 14.40.41] Yousif Zaid: During sebs birthday dinner we were walking back to my car and Sebastian accidentally walked infront of two drunk polish dudes and one of them bumped into him and got in his face
[27/07/2025, 14.41.04] Yousif Zaid: And I made this face and actually started praying to god that Sebastian wouldn’t say something dumb like “well EXCUSE you!!”
[27/07/2025, 14.41.49] Yousif Zaid: Like I switched to Arabic mentally and went “god please shut him up”. I hope I didn’t already tell you about this [27/07/2025, 15.36.49] Ems : I think you got lucky because I just don't see Sebastian being rude to someone
[27/07/2025, 15.48.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 16.06.55] Ems : Looks quite relaxing actually
[27/07/2025, 16.07.06] Ems : Are you bored today as well?
[27/07/2025, 16.07.17] Yousif Zaid: Meeting Laura for a coffee and a walk
[27/07/2025, 16.07.22] Yousif Zaid: João cancelled on me for drinks
[27/07/2025, 16.07.40] Yousif Zaid: Louis can’t, Abid cant, John cant
[27/07/2025, 16.08.00] Yousif Zaid: I want to start a new book but I’m not sure what
[27/07/2025, 16.08.24] Ems : No jailhouse today then
[27/07/2025, 16.08.35] Ems : You've read 1984 right?
[27/07/2025, 16.08.54] Yousif Zaid: So long ago that I’ve completely forgotten
[27/07/2025, 16.09.17] Yousif Zaid: From what joaos told me it really doesn’t seem like my kind of place
[27/07/2025, 16.09.48] Ems : What kind of books are you thinking of? I can definitely recommend some
[27/07/2025, 16.10.07] Ems : Yeah no if you ever do go I want documented evidence
[27/07/2025, 16.10.13] Yousif Zaid: Honestly it’s just the length
[27/07/2025, 16.10.37] Yousif Zaid: I have uncle toms cabin and shit and Anna Karenina and War and Peace but I cannot read another long book
[27/07/2025, 16.10.50] Yousif Zaid: Would be a good laugh if we both went with joao one day
[27/07/2025, 16.17.18] Ems : And then there were none, (the best mystery book)
Lord of the flies The silent patient(best plot twist ever)
1984
[27/07/2025, 16.17.59] Ems : These are very good books, the silent patient is a page turner if that's what you're looking for
[27/07/2025, 16.18.23] Ems : But I think you would enjoy all four of these
[27/07/2025, 16.18.25] Yousif Zaid: Mostly just something short and lighthearted
[27/07/2025, 16.18.30] Ems : Please let's
[27/07/2025, 16.18.39] Ems : Ok then not these
[27/07/2025, 16.18.52] Ems : They aren't lighthearted but very good
[27/07/2025, 16.19.00] Yousif Zaid: By lighthearted I mean “I don’t have to think about god or dying”
[27/07/2025, 16.19.17] Yousif Zaid: Nothing Russian
[27/07/2025, 16.19.25] Yousif Zaid: Might do lord of the flies then
[27/07/2025, 16.19.36] Yousif Zaid: If I had to read one of these which would it be
[27/07/2025, 16.20.19] Ems : Like the least existential ones are and then there were none and the silent patient
[27/07/2025, 16.20.29] Ems : But lord of the flies is a classic
[27/07/2025, 16.20.41] Yousif Zaid: I’ll go to a bookstore today then
[27/07/2025, 16.22.28] Ems : Let me know which you choose
I could advise you better if I was home with the books in front of me but these are solid
[27/07/2025, 16.24.21] Yousif Zaid: Will do
[27/07/2025, 18.35.58] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 18.35.59] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 18.51.16] Ems : Looking really cool
[27/07/2025, 18.51.22] Ems : No clown shows today
[27/07/2025, 18.51.46] Ems : Perfect for the coffee and walk, you really look the part
[27/07/2025, 21.45.45] Yousif Zaid: It ended up being a cheesecake/lemonade and walk
[27/07/2025, 21.45.55] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 21.45.55] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[27/07/2025, 22.21.50] Ems : Laura looks lovely
[27/07/2025, 22.21.57] Ems : The place is gorgeous
[27/07/2025, 22.22.13] Yousif Zaid: Frederiksberg garden. There’s a museum in there and the zoo next to it
[27/07/2025, 22.22.20] Yousif Zaid: I’ve never actually been to the zoo
[27/07/2025, 22.22.51] Ems : Oh I've seen it from outside
[27/07/2025, 22.23.14] Yousif Zaid: I feel like I should remember your favourite animal
[27/07/2025, 22.23.23] Ems : Was it nicer than frederiksborg?
[27/07/2025, 22.23.38] Yousif Zaid: Hm. No, Frederiksborg castle is prettier
[27/07/2025, 22.23.44] Ems : Go on
[27/07/2025, 22.23.48] Yousif Zaid: But it’s nice in its own way
[27/07/2025, 22.23.54] Yousif Zaid: I literally don’t
[27/07/2025, 22.23.58] Ems : The gardens were beautiful
[27/07/2025, 22.24.14] Yousif Zaid: I feel like I SHOULD remember
[27/07/2025, 22.24.35] Ems : I don't have one animal, the one that it always used to be was dolphin
[27/07/2025, 22.24.52] Ems : I wore a dolphin necklace for like four years
[27/07/2025, 22.24.56] Yousif Zaid: Anyhow me and Laura sat on a bench and we discussed her relationship to this lady she’s seeing
[27/07/2025, 22.25.03] Yousif Zaid: I wanted to say manatee
[27/07/2025, 22.25.59] Ems : That sounds nice is everything going ok
[27/07/2025, 22.26.15] Ems : Dolphins are prettier though, and I think more intelligent
[27/07/2025, 22.26.21] Ems : I might be lying though
[27/07/2025, 22.26.24] Yousif Zaid: Manatees are way funnier
[27/07/2025, 22.26.45] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 22.26.51] Ems : image omitted
[27/07/2025, 22.27.04] Ems : We just sent the same thing
[27/07/2025, 22.27.10] Yousif Zaid: To me this creature is relatable
[27/07/2025, 22.27.28] Yousif Zaid: Great minds
[27/07/2025, 22.27.44] Ems : It feels like they're a bit sad all the time
[27/07/2025, 22.27.56] Ems : It's the eyes
[27/07/2025, 22.28.10] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 22.28.14] Yousif Zaid: 5 hours of sleep
[27/07/2025, 22.28.32] Ems : Exactly
[27/07/2025, 22.28.38] Yousif Zaid: Steven is talking about change of basis and I’m not understanding anything
[27/07/2025, 22.29.00] Ems : If Steven is talking I'm ok as long as vedant isn't
[27/07/2025, 22.29.03] Ems : To be honest
[27/07/2025, 22.29.06] Yousif Zaid: They always have their hands up in front of them as if to gesture confusion
[27/07/2025, 22.29.10] Yousif Zaid: And I’m confused often
[27/07/2025, 22.29.45] Ems : You're lying
[27/07/2025, 22.29.47] Yousif Zaid: Laura wants it to be more couple-like
[27/07/2025, 22.29.58] Ems : Most often it's you explaining stuff to people
[27/07/2025, 22.30.08] Yousif Zaid: Bollocks
[27/07/2025, 22.30.24] Yousif Zaid: I’m hanging out with John too much
[27/07/2025, 22.30.35] Ems : You're starting to be so British, John is influencing you
[27/07/2025, 22.30.43] Yousif Zaid: GREAT MINDS
[27/07/2025, 22.30.54] Ems : It's getting worrying now
[27/07/2025, 22.31.03] Ems : That's twice in a row
[27/07/2025, 22.31.17] Yousif Zaid: See on one hand you call me smart
[27/07/2025, 22.31.26] Yousif Zaid: On the other you say it’s worrying you think like me
[27/07/2025, 22.31.49] Yousif Zaid: So I told her it could be a good idea to ask her to be her girlfriend officially this week when they see each other
[27/07/2025, 22.32.43] Ems : I think that's good advice
[27/07/2025, 22.33.06] Ems : I hope it goes well because that means she really puts herself on the line
[27/07/2025, 22.33.22] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes you have to, right?
[27/07/2025, 22.33.42] Yousif Zaid: Unless of course you’re Indian and the woman in question is Emma Leone
[27/07/2025, 22.34.44] Ems : I'm not saying it's bad, just worrying, I think another person saying what I think can't be good
[27/07/2025, 22.35.09] Ems : Yes I agree, I just hope it goes well for Laura
[27/07/2025, 22.35.24] Ems : This doesn't deserve an answer
[27/07/2025, 22.35.37] Yousif Zaid: I mean they LIKE each other and go on dates it’s just a matter of putting the stamp on the visa, so to speak
[27/07/2025, 22.36.05] Yousif Zaid: It’s not incorrect
[27/07/2025, 22.36.57] Yousif Zaid: I think it’s just a case of gen Z dating app shyness. Besides if Laura wants it more cutesy and romantic she should probably at least make the lady her girlfriend and see if that helps
[27/07/2025, 22.38.47] Ems : You're right, I'm happy for her that she's doing it
[27/07/2025, 22.39.13] Yousif Zaid: That’s the thing I’m not so sure she’s gonna do it
[27/07/2025, 22.39.26] Yousif Zaid: The lesbians they pussyfoot around a lot
[27/07/2025, 22.39.28] Yousif Zaid: Ha
[27/07/2025, 22.40.47] Ems : I'm mad that I laughed
[27/07/2025, 22.41.06] Yousif Zaid: I exhaled through my nose a bit and I feel shame
[27/07/2025, 22.41.11] Ems : They do though
[27/07/2025, 22.41.32] Yousif Zaid: Usually there’s a guy that has to act like an oaf and embarrass himself and that’s the price to pay
[27/07/2025, 22.41.44] Yousif Zaid: But here we have two delicate little flowers that just couldn’t possibly
[27/07/2025, 22.42.49] Ems : Laura's just going to have to wear the pants in this situation
[27/07/2025, 22.43.03] Yousif Zaid: Funny enough her woman wears pants and Laura is well
[27/07/2025, 22.43.10] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/07/2025, 22.43.39] Ems : You're a good photographer I'll give you that
[27/07/2025, 22.43.46] Yousif Zaid: It was very funny Laura was so infatuated with this girl that when I met with her once and hugged her hello Laura looked up at me and giggled
[27/07/2025, 22.44.01] Yousif Zaid: She said “she’s taller than you :))” and when I met her she was like noticeably shorter than me
[27/07/2025, 22.44.21] Yousif Zaid: The gal wears denim overalls
[27/07/2025, 22.44.39] Yousif Zaid: She’s also having trouble flirting with her because they speak Danish together and it’s just impossible
[27/07/2025, 22.45.56] Ems : It sounds like it would be such a cute scene to see
[27/07/2025, 22.46.41] Yousif Zaid: Gross language
[27/07/2025, 22.46.58] Ems : I slept like 3 hours last night so I'm going to head to sleep
[27/07/2025, 22.47.06] Ems : I'm not taking module 3
[27/07/2025, 22.47.08] Ems : No way
[27/07/2025, 22.47.13] Yousif Zaid: Hahahahahah
[27/07/2025, 22.47.18] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight ems
[27/07/2025, 22.47.26] Ems : Night yuyu
[28/07/2025, 11.28.51] Yousif Zaid: Just got a reminder mail, register for your courses if you haven’t already
[28/07/2025, 13.51.21] Ems : I did even before they sent the mail considering what happened in January hahahahaha
[28/07/2025, 13.51.24] Ems : Thank you
[28/07/2025, 13.53.38] Yousif Zaid: I got a parking ticket with a dtu car cuz I was out working with it
[28/07/2025, 13.53.51] Yousif Zaid: Turns out I have to pay it on my own
[28/07/2025, 13.54.12] Yousif Zaid: 900. A day and a half’s wages. Financially I’d have been better off calling in sick today
[28/07/2025, 13.54.17] Yousif Zaid: Damn shame
[28/07/2025, 14.17.29] Ems : Noo that sucks I'm sorry
[28/07/2025, 14.17.41] Ems : 900 is really steep what the fuck are they doing
[28/07/2025, 14.17.53] Ems : Were you delivering something?
[28/07/2025, 14.22.44] Yousif Zaid: I was taking a work phone to a repair shop
[28/07/2025, 14.22.58] Yousif Zaid: It says I parked 13:01 and they gave the fine 13:03
[28/07/2025, 14.23.14] Yousif Zaid: Please tell me you’re having a better day than me
[28/07/2025, 14.24.12] Yousif Zaid: Only thing left today for me is to be hit by a car
[28/07/2025, 14.28.26] Ems : No way
[28/07/2025, 14.28.30] Ems : Please don't do that
[28/07/2025, 14.29.22] Ems : Well there's a thunderstorm now so we're just home but we went to pick blackberries this morning I'll show you
[28/07/2025, 14.29.38] Yousif Zaid: That’s nice :)
[28/07/2025, 14.29.49] Yousif Zaid: Not on purpose I just mean with my luck I might as well

[28/07/2025, 14.31.44] Yousif Zaid: We have a blackberry bush near my house and my neighbors come to pick berries off it. My father gets annoyed at them
[28/07/2025, 14.31.55] Ems : No I got that maybe stay away from roads for the day
[28/07/2025, 14.32.14] Yousif Zaid: Today is not my day I should just stay the fuck home

[28/07/2025, 14.35.02] Ems : Hope to god
[28/07/2025, 14.35.23] Yousif Zaid: It’s a puppy that ate a whole bowl of blackberry jam and took a nap relax would you
[28/07/2025, 14.35.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s meant to be cute
[28/07/2025, 14.39.06] Ems : Ok out of context i was really worried
[28/07/2025, 14.39.11] Ems : SO CUTE
[28/07/2025, 14.39.18] Ems : Actually
[28/07/2025, 14.39.20] Ems : I'm relieved
[28/07/2025, 14.39.28] Yousif Zaid: Yeah when you said you ate 2 kg of blackberries that’s what I pictured
[28/07/2025, 15.28.02] Ems : It's quite accurate
[28/07/2025, 15.29.00] Yousif Zaid: Meeting a friend for a coffee downtown, gonna stop by in a bookshop
[28/07/2025, 15.29.09] Yousif Zaid: One answer: what book do I buy
[28/07/2025, 15.29.38] Yousif Zaid: And then there were none or the silent patient?
[28/07/2025, 15.31.09] Yousif Zaid: Your observation about Asian couples always walking together arm in arm ruined mine and Laura’s evening yesterday btw. We spotted like 100 pairs of them and had trouble not laughing in strangers faces just because they were Asian
[28/07/2025, 15.31.38] Ems : Aaa it's hard
Do you want a more contemporary one or old?
[28/07/2025, 15.31.53] Yousif Zaid: I want emma’s rec man
[28/07/2025, 15.31.52] Ems : THEY'RE ALWAYS TOGETHER
[28/07/2025, 15.32.01] Ems : God the pressure
[28/07/2025, 15.32.24] Yousif Zaid: They’re always together man
[28/07/2025, 15.32.42] Ems : Go with and then there were none because you have to read it
[28/07/2025, 15.32.45] Yousif Zaid: Look if it makes you feel any better I kind of doubt I can find the silent patient in a store
[28/07/2025, 15.32.50] Ems : Next time silent patient
[28/07/2025, 15.32.55] Ems : Oh you definitely can
[28/07/2025, 15.33.08] Yousif Zaid: I’ll get both if I find both
[28/07/2025, 15.33.37] Yousif Zaid: I told Laura and she was like “yousif I think you’re talking out of your ass” and we immediately saw a pair
[28/07/2025, 15.34.06] Ems : I think they're both great, and then there were none is amazing, don't let anyone spoiler either for you
[28/07/2025, 15.34.31] Yousif Zaid: You’re the only person I speak to about books I get bullied for reading otherwise
[28/07/2025, 15.34.32] Ems : Also when I see people with dogs, the owner always looks like their dog
[28/07/2025, 15.34.53] Yousif Zaid: It’s funny you should say that cuz I just walked past a dog that looked exactly like me
[28/07/2025, 15.35.05] Yousif Zaid: I was somehow more hairy
[28/07/2025, 15.35.16] Ems : What dog was it hahahahahahha
[28/07/2025, 15.35.26] Yousif Zaid: Not sure about the breed but it was incredibly handsome
[28/07/2025, 15.35.40] Yousif Zaid: Covered in fur but somehow you still had the impression it had a beard
[28/07/2025, 15.35.47] Yousif Zaid: And a mullet
[28/07/2025, 15.36.13] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[28/07/2025, 15.42.27] Ems : That's you
[28/07/2025, 15.42.42] Ems : Kick them fuck ducks and swans
[28/07/2025, 15.42.54] Ems : Why are their egos so high
[28/07/2025, 15.43.30] Yousif Zaid: Definitely racist
[28/07/2025, 15.46.09] Ems : And sexist
[28/07/2025, 15.46.23] Ems : That swan was not joking with me
[28/07/2025, 16.39.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[28/07/2025, 16.48.37] Ems : I'm so jealous first of all because you bought new books and also because you get to read those two books for the first time
[28/07/2025, 16.50.17] Ems : Can you send a picture of the back cover of the other two books
[28/07/2025, 16.50.21] Ems : I'm curious
[28/07/2025, 19.42.59] Yousif Zaid: Yes sorry I just got home
[28/07/2025, 20.00.56] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[28/07/2025, 20.01.04] Yousif Zaid: This is the back of “Nausea”
[28/07/2025, 20.01.25] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[28/07/2025, 20.01.47] Yousif Zaid: For this one I just knew I wanted to read something by Anais Nin and grabbed the first thing I saw
[28/07/2025, 20.01.53] Yousif Zaid: Same with Sartre here
[28/07/2025, 20.06.21] Yousif Zaid: In addition I’ve grabbed some books from my apartment
[28/07/2025, 20.06.43] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[28/07/2025, 20.28.03] Ems : They actually both seem really great
[28/07/2025, 20.28.24] Ems : You've become such a bookworm
[28/07/2025, 20.29.01] Ems : This is great finally someone to trade books with
[28/07/2025, 21.33.58] Yousif Zaid: It’s funny because anais nin is one of those authors you lie about reading to impress ladies at the book store
[28/07/2025, 21.34.38] Yousif Zaid: But Sartre is someone you lie about reading to impress moody guys who are terrible people that you shouldn’t be dating
[28/07/2025, 21.35.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s been that way for a while I’ve just been stuck on the brothers karamazov for literally the entire time you’ve known me
[28/07/2025, 21.35.53] Yousif Zaid: Yemma book club
[29/07/2025, 01.43.42] Yousif Zaid: Ur probably asleep but you’ll reply before I wake up and have to take a book with me to work. And then there were none or the silent patient first?
[29/07/2025, 05.41.01] Ems : Between the two of them you should have a cigarette permanently placed behind your ear
[29/07/2025, 05.41.26] Ems : .
[29/07/2025, 07.56.33] Yousif Zaid: Done

[29/07/2025, 08.15.03] Ems : Same here
[29/07/2025, 08.15.07] Ems : What happened to you?
[29/07/2025, 08.15.35] Yousif Zaid: I woke up every half hour at least
[29/07/2025, 08.15.51] Yousif Zaid: You?
[29/07/2025, 08.18.41] Ems : That sucks it's the worst
[29/07/2025, 08.18.47] Ems : I think I had it better
[29/07/2025, 08.18.52] Ems : I just woke up at 5
[29/07/2025, 08.19.03] Ems : But it's the third day in a row
[29/07/2025, 08.19.18] Yousif Zaid: Body must still be in exam mode somehow
[29/07/2025, 08.20.40] Yousif Zaid: What do you do all morning?
[29/07/2025, 08.35.05] Ems : Eh I read or I bake but the family wakes up early as well

[29/07/2025, 09.18.17] Ems : I might be going crazy but
[29/07/2025, 09.18.20] Ems : Hear me out
[29/07/2025, 09.18.26] Yousif Zaid: No
[29/07/2025, 09.18.29] Ems : It's kind of good
[29/07/2025, 09.18.31] Ems : Kind of

[29/07/2025, 09.23.52] Ems : You know I'll play it in the car
[29/07/2025, 09.24.04] Ems : I'm the dj you'll have to accept it
[29/07/2025, 09.24.16] Yousif Zaid: What kind of dj plays benson Boone man
[29/07/2025, 09.24.22] Ems : I said his name now you listen to the song

[29/07/2025, 09.28.43] Yousif Zaid: Didn’t he do that
[29/07/2025, 09.28.52] Ems : Listen to the song if you have the courage

[29/07/2025, 09.30.03] Yousif Zaid: See this is a proper guilty pleasure
[29/07/2025, 09.33.17] Yousif Zaid: People keep coming back from vacation and asking me if “I’ve really been here this whole time” and it’s making me depressed
[29/07/2025, 09.42.15] Ems : But I'm not saying it's good
[29/07/2025, 09.42.50] Ems : I'm just saying it's the kind of song where you would start singing along because it's catchy
[29/07/2025, 09.43.03] Yousif Zaid: Herpes is also catchy ems
[29/07/2025, 09.43.06] Ems : You're going away soon and they'll hate you for it

[29/07/2025, 11.21.35] Yousif Zaid: I’m good!
[29/07/2025, 11.22.32] Yousif Zaid: Have you found out whether you’re going to Albania ? [29/07/2025, 11.32.12] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[29/07/2025, 12.52.48] Yousif Zaid: That’s nice, do you know where to? I read the first 30 pages of the book and it’s a lot of characters to remember
[29/07/2025, 15.54.47] Ems : That's definitely a way to enjoy work
[29/07/2025, 15.55.35] Ems : We don't know yet I know the book needs a bit to get into but at the end of the day it's 10 characters so you'll be fine
[29/07/2025, 15.56.04] Yousif Zaid: I can’t count that high
[29/07/2025, 15.56.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m checking my mailbox every day and getting disappointed
[29/07/2025, 15.56.50] Yousif Zaid: The Greeks are a worthless people
[29/07/2025, 15.56.51] Ems : I know it might be a challenge
[29/07/2025, 15.57.10] Ems : Give it two more days maybe? How long has it been?
[29/07/2025, 15.57.24] Ems : Yeah that was very clear in my mind
[29/07/2025, 15.57.46] Yousif Zaid: 22nd of July you said this
[29/07/2025, 15.58.04] Ems : Well
[29/07/2025, 15.58.25] Ems : Ok I say a week more if not I took pictures but it's not the same
[29/07/2025, 15.58.26] Yousif Zaid: It’s like asking a hungry infant to deliver a bottle of milk
[29/07/2025, 15.58.39] Yousif Zaid: Trusting a Greek guy to do any task
[29/07/2025, 15.58.49] Ems : He would probably do the job better
[29/07/2025, 15.58.57] Yousif Zaid: 100%
[29/07/2025, 15.59.15] Yousif Zaid: We keep waiting im stubborn
[29/07/2025, 15.59.37] Yousif Zaid: I think I may have been poisoned I’ve been dead tired for like 2 days
[29/07/2025, 15.59.52] Yousif Zaid: I got home from work I could barely stand up right I’m slumped on the couch right now
[29/07/2025, 16.00.25] Ems : I get you I'm in the same situation
[29/07/2025, 16.00.53] Ems : And I have family I've never met coming over tonight
[29/07/2025, 16.01.02] Yousif Zaid: Christ almighty
[29/07/2025, 16.01.16] Yousif Zaid: “You’ve grown so much you were only so big!” Lady who are you
[29/07/2025, 16.01.59] Ems : Exactly
[29/07/2025, 16.02.03] Ems : I can't wait for that
[29/07/2025, 16.02.28] Yousif Zaid: “So when do you think you’re getting married”
[29/07/2025, 16.02.34] Ems : God and they're coming with the train at like 9 so I'm probably going to sleep at 1
[29/07/2025, 16.02.38] Yousif Zaid: Auntie I have no prospects leave me alone
[29/07/2025, 16.02.47] Ems : No If they ask me that I'm going to bed immediately

[29/07/2025, 16.02.56] Ems : [29/07/2025, 16.03.06] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted
[29/07/2025, 16.03.27] Ems : Yup
[29/07/2025, 16.03.41] Ems : I just want to sleep it shouldn't be this hard
[29/07/2025, 16.04.12] Yousif Zaid: This is sickening
[29/07/2025, 16.04.33] Yousif Zaid: My dad was like “do we invite John over for dinner” and I just wanted to be left alone I said please no
[29/07/2025, 16.04.37] Yousif Zaid: I do not envy you
[29/07/2025, 16.15.47] Ems : You must be really tired if you said no to john
[29/07/2025, 16.22.57] Yousif Zaid: I’m completely broiled. Tell me how bad the 9 pm family assault ends up being
[29/07/2025, 16.49.35] Ems : I Just did the most embarrassing thing ever
[29/07/2025, 16.50.32] Ems : I was in the supermarket and I asked a random guy where the frozen fruit was and he was like " look, I don't work here" and he looked so genuinely worried
[29/07/2025, 18.06.59] Yousif Zaid: Once a lady did the same to me in an electronics store. I didn’t want to make things awkward so I just poked the actual employee on the side and said “this lady needs help” and she gets mad as fuck
[29/07/2025, 18.07.10] Yousif Zaid: “Why won’t HE help me??!!” While she’s pointing at me
[29/07/2025, 18.07.49] Yousif Zaid: And I just look at her with a really big shit eating grin and her fussing about attracts more attention and employees and they’re all confused
[29/07/2025, 18.08.27] Yousif Zaid: She points at me again and all the employees are like “who the fuck is that guy” and at the end I said idk what her problem is I don’t even work here
[29/07/2025, 20.11.39] Ems : See now that's crazy
[29/07/2025, 20.12.04] Ems : Why did she assume that? Were you wearing a shirt of the same colour as the store workers?
[29/07/2025, 20.12.18] Yousif Zaid: Perhaps I just looked competent
[29/07/2025, 20.12.18] Ems : That man just looked really offended
[29/07/2025, 20.12.33] Ems : Perhaps
[29/07/2025, 20.12.35] Yousif Zaid: Your story is not so embarrassing
[29/07/2025, 20.12.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s like calling the preschool teacher mom
[29/07/2025, 20.12.47] Yousif Zaid: Everyone does it
[29/07/2025, 20.13.09] Ems : Yeah but you get second hand embarrassment when someone does it
[29/07/2025, 20.13.31] Yousif Zaid: I wasn’t smart enough to feel second hand embarrassment that young
[29/07/2025, 20.13.40] Yousif Zaid: This book is cinema I’m halfway through it [29/07/2025, 20.14.05] Ems : RIGHT??
[29/07/2025, 20.14.17] Yousif Zaid: I’ll be very impressed if this is all explained logically somehow
[29/07/2025, 20.14.23] Yousif Zaid: Cuz this shit is ridiculous so far
[29/07/2025, 20.14.45] Ems : You're gonna be shocked it's going to be awesome
[29/07/2025, 20.14.58] Ems : What's happening right now?
[29/07/2025, 20.15.02] Yousif Zaid: Kind of feels like you’re the narrator telling me the story
[29/07/2025, 20.15.17] Ems : That's so cool
[29/07/2025, 20.15.28] Yousif Zaid: Pretty boy choked to death on his whiskey and soda and the butlers wife died of fright or whatever
[29/07/2025, 20.15.30] Ems : I don't think I'm clever enough to come up with that
[29/07/2025, 20.15.34] Yousif Zaid: Boats not here yet to take them home
[29/07/2025, 20.15.38] Ems : AH I LOVE THIS
[29/07/2025, 20.15.47] Ems : That you're reading it
[29/07/2025, 20.15.54] Ems : Not that they die
[29/07/2025, 20.16.17] Yousif Zaid: No I just mean that since you recommended it to me so much and are so excited about me reading it that it feels like somehow you’re the one telling the story
[29/07/2025, 20.16.34] Ems : No I got that
[29/07/2025, 20.16.37] Ems : By the way
[29/07/2025, 20.16.39] Yousif Zaid: Like when you listen to a song that a friend recommended but through their eyes
[29/07/2025, 20.16.43] Ems : If you have any theories
[29/07/2025, 20.16.49] Ems : Tell me I won't spoil
[29/07/2025, 20.16.51] Ems : I promise
[29/07/2025, 20.17.01] Yousif Zaid: That judge seems a bit strange
[29/07/2025, 20.17.11] Ems : I see what you mean I like that
[29/07/2025, 20.17.40] Ems : I'm going to ignore every theory you send
[29/07/2025, 20.17.44] Yousif Zaid: Like someone drops dead infront of him and everyone is accused of a murder and he’s decided he’s the boss now all of a sudden
[29/07/2025, 20.17.56] Ems : Ok
[29/07/2025, 20.18.14] Yousif Zaid: I’m sad pretty boy died I was imagining myself in that place
[29/07/2025, 20.18.30] Yousif Zaid: Driving in a fast car all young and shit
[29/07/2025, 20.18.38] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHA
[29/07/2025, 20.18.48] Yousif Zaid: Guess I’m the first to go
[29/07/2025, 20.19.04] Ems : You kind of knew that you've told me that before

[29/07/2025, 20.24.40] Ems : The back cover kind of gave it away
[29/07/2025, 20.24.51] Ems : He's feelin himself
[29/07/2025, 20.25.03] Yousif Zaid: Sounds like something I’d say but I’m talking about a math problem
[29/07/2025, 20.25.29] Ems : In your office in front of the board
[29/07/2025, 20.25.30] Yousif Zaid: Idk I thought it would be a bit more subtle but no it’s just supposed to be porn but in an English class format
[29/07/2025, 20.25.40] Ems : Nice
[29/07/2025, 20.25.51] Yousif Zaid: If it’s good I’ll lend it to you. Is that weird?
[29/07/2025, 20.26.06] Yousif Zaid: “I’m a problem!!!!”
[29/07/2025, 20.26.15] Ems : Nah I'd like to read it if it's good
[29/07/2025, 20.26.29] Ems : Murakami was weird as well so it's fine
[29/07/2025, 20.26.35] Yousif Zaid: Half an hour til the stranger family shows up
[29/07/2025, 20.26.38] Yousif Zaid: How are we feeling
[29/07/2025, 20.26.56] Ems : I took a shower to mentally prepare myself
[29/07/2025, 20.27.23] Ems : I've decided that I'll just go to bed when I'm tired who cares
[29/07/2025, 20.27.23] Yousif Zaid: Sitting down in the shower is a ritual
[29/07/2025, 20.27.35] Ems : It's probably going to be 9.30 though
[29/07/2025, 20.27.43] Yousif Zaid: You’re such an old lady
[29/07/2025, 20.27.58] Ems : What can I say I get tired
[29/07/2025, 20.28.06] Yousif Zaid: “My sensibilities!! I must sleep”
[29/07/2025, 20.28.08] Ems : You say this just because I bake
[29/07/2025, 20.28.27] Ems : I couldn't possibly stay up past my bedtime
[29/07/2025, 20.28.37] Yousif Zaid: It’s the emma of it all
[29/07/2025, 20.28.49] Yousif Zaid: I hope I become a good old man when the time comes
[29/07/2025, 20.28.59] Yousif Zaid: You’ve got it down
[29/07/2025, 20.29.36] Ems : I know that I don't want to be a mean old lady
[29/07/2025, 20.29.46] Ems : Not a judgy one that's all
[29/07/2025, 20.29.50] Yousif Zaid: I can’t ever see you being mean
[29/07/2025, 20.30.05] Yousif Zaid: My grandma on my dad’s side can’t cook. Can you believe that?
[29/07/2025, 20.30.23] Yousif Zaid: An Arab family with a grandma that can’t cook
[29/07/2025, 20.30.25] Ems : Apart from the Aidan/Sheldon thing
[29/07/2025, 20.30.41] Ems : I got beef with your grandma I'm sorry
[29/07/2025, 20.30.42] Yousif Zaid: You gutted him like a fish [29/07/2025, 20.30.48] Yousif Zaid: I fucking got beef with her
[29/07/2025, 20.31.07] Yousif Zaid: On the subject of grandparents I’m basically a fascist
[29/07/2025, 20.31.20] Yousif Zaid: They gotta be a certain way otherwise the world falls apart
[29/07/2025, 20.32.07] Ems : That's so true
[29/07/2025, 20.32.07] Ems : They're either amazing or awful
[29/07/2025, 20.32.11] Ems : I got lucky
[29/07/2025, 20.32.23] Yousif Zaid: 3/4 ain’t bad
[29/07/2025, 20.32.29] Yousif Zaid: Well. 2/3 now
[29/07/2025, 20.32.36] Yousif Zaid: Rest in peace gramps [29/07/2025, 20.34.51] Ems : That's good stats
[29/07/2025, 20.35.46] Yousif Zaid: Good luck with the intruders, I’m probably gonna finish this book tonight
[29/07/2025, 20.37.48] Ems : I want your final reaction, I'm going to help my mom cook

[29/07/2025, 23.34.57] Ems : Good for him
[29/07/2025, 23.35.03] Ems : Yousif..
[29/07/2025, 23.35.13] Yousif Zaid: Ah you’re up
[29/07/2025, 23.35.15] Ems : Yeah wait for tomorrow I'm too tired I just got away
[29/07/2025, 23.35.19] Ems : Barely
[29/07/2025, 23.35.25] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know
[29/07/2025, 23.35.39] Ems : What the fuck man
[29/07/2025, 23.35.45] Ems : It's funny though
[29/07/2025, 23.35.52] Yousif Zaid: João should be in that second group chat
[29/07/2025, 23.35.56] Yousif Zaid: In my defense
[29/07/2025, 23.36.01] Yousif Zaid: I honestly thought he was
[29/07/2025, 23.36.13] Ems : It's just a bit funny
[29/07/2025, 23.36.19] Ems : It's fine
[29/07/2025, 23.36.24] Yousif Zaid: God I can hear you saying this
[29/07/2025, 23.36.33] Yousif Zaid: Just straight disappointed
[29/07/2025, 23.36.46] Ems : Hahahahahaha
[29/07/2025, 23.36.54] Ems : You know the voice
[29/07/2025, 23.37.14] Yousif Zaid: Soheyl said I was a retard
[29/07/2025, 23.37.25] Yousif Zaid: I had to tell him so he could back up the lie about the high school group chat
[29/07/2025, 23.37.26] Ems : I would say he's wrong
[29/07/2025, 23.37.28] Ems : But
[29/07/2025, 23.37.43] Yousif Zaid: You’re a saint
[29/07/2025, 23.37.52] Ems : .
[29/07/2025, 23.38.13] Yousif Zaid: There are many ways an English woman can call you retarded without saying it
[29/07/2025, 23.38.23] Ems : Exactly
[29/07/2025, 23.38.27] Ems : You know how it is
[29/07/2025, 23.38.41] Yousif Zaid: I respect it.
[29/07/2025, 23.38.49] Yousif Zaid: Bedtime for you then?
[29/07/2025, 23.39.03] Ems : Yeah it's a long day tomorrow as well
[29/07/2025, 23.39.06] Ems : Goodnight
[29/07/2025, 23.39.11] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight ems
[29/07/2025, 23.39.22] Ems : Night yuyu
[30/07/2025, 10.20.25] Yousif Zaid: I bought 6 fucking cartons of milk for the coffee machine on Monday and we’re already out
[30/07/2025, 10.21.31] Yousif Zaid: I’m literally milk boy
[30/07/2025, 10.33.43] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[30/07/2025, 11.44.33] Ems : Yeah that's right give them a real challenge
[30/07/2025, 11.44.47] Ems : Tell me about the book
[30/07/2025, 11.45.15] Yousif Zaid: I was so fucking confused man
[30/07/2025, 11.45.31] Yousif Zaid: Like the ending was getting closer and closer and things were not getting any clearer at all
[30/07/2025, 11.45.50] Yousif Zaid: I nearly didn’t read the judges message in a bottle cuz I thought it was some advertisement for a different book
[30/07/2025, 11.46.38] Yousif Zaid: I’m a bit torn up because the plot is very clever and I can understand the author wanting to explain it all away
[30/07/2025, 11.46.44] Yousif Zaid: But a part of me wishes she hadn’t ?
[30/07/2025, 11.47.20] Yousif Zaid: Like if the book just ended with the cops going “what the fuck man” I’d have thought about it for a very very long time but now that everything is answered it’s kind of like whatever
[30/07/2025, 11.48.06] Ems : I think you're so wrong if she hadn't explained it just would've been another unsolved mystery and there's no cleverness in that
[30/07/2025, 11.48.16] Ems : I did the exact same
[30/07/2025, 11.48.34] Yousif Zaid: Maybe leave it to us?
[30/07/2025, 11.49.32] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know, something about this guys motive just being “I want to murder people that I feel are guilty” is a bit idk
[30/07/2025, 11.50.24] Ems : He's a judge
[30/07/2025, 11.50.37] Yousif Zaid: I really loved the book and the premise and I thought it was great but maybe if some clues were sprinkled in and it was a conclusion we could reach on our own then that would have been cooler, is all
[30/07/2025, 11.51.37] Yousif Zaid: That being said the authors explanation is very clever and cool, I didn’t expect him to have faked his own death
[30/07/2025, 11.53.38] Ems : Fair enough
[30/07/2025, 11.53.49] Yousif Zaid: But in my opinion a more lasting impression would be if the book made the reader feel clever and not “oh Agatha Christie is clever”
[30/07/2025, 11.53.57] Yousif Zaid: I know she’s clever already she’s a renowned author
[30/07/2025, 11.55.01] Yousif Zaid: What did you think ?
[30/07/2025, 11.57.54] Ems : I haven't read it since I was 14 but I thought it was really good
In my opinion if I can easily figure out who did it the crime book isn't good enough Also if I remember correctly there were some clues around, maybe I'm wrong about that
I agree that the motive could be better, but I feel that since he's a judge it makes sense. I think that the main clue that was given was Vera's sense of guilt
[30/07/2025, 11.58.35] Yousif Zaid: I agree with it not being good enough if it’s easy to figure out
[30/07/2025, 11.59.15] Yousif Zaid: Interestingly enough you could figure out that it was the judge because he was the only one who didn’t actually do anything wrong in his gramophone accusation, the rest of the people were guilty but he actually executed that guilty murderer correctly [30/07/2025, 12.00.10] Yousif Zaid: The motive makes perfect sense it was just clumsy
[30/07/2025, 12.00.50] Ems : Oh true I forgot about that
[30/07/2025, 12.01.26] Ems : I think perhaps you feel disappointed because it's something that sometimes happens to me really often at the end of books
[30/07/2025, 12.01.40] Ems : I think this book is done so well though
[30/07/2025, 12.01.46] Yousif Zaid: It really is
[30/07/2025, 12.02.11] Yousif Zaid: It’s just that when I finished the main part and the last sentence was the cops being confused, I thought that was it and my brain was on fire
[30/07/2025, 12.02.22] Yousif Zaid: Then the message in a bottle just made me go “oh, well that’s neat ” [30/07/2025, 12.03.21] Ems : I would've been so fucking angry
Anyone can write a very confusing series of events
[30/07/2025, 12.03.42] Ems : I can do that no problem, the smart part is explaining it
[30/07/2025, 12.03.48] Yousif Zaid: Maybe a partial explanation would have been a good middle ground
[30/07/2025, 12.07.20] Ems : You'll have to tell me how it goes tonight with the group
[30/07/2025, 12.18.41] Yousif Zaid: I will, how did it go with the aunties yesterday?
[30/07/2025, 15.53.43] Ems : Sorry I haven't been answering, the funeral was this morning so it's been a bit tiring but I'm fine
[30/07/2025, 15.53.53] Ems : I'll answer when I get home
[30/07/2025, 15.58.44] Yousif Zaid: I can’t lie to you I saw the notification and laughed
[30/07/2025, 15.59.06] Yousif Zaid: “Sorry I wasn’t texting grandmas funeral was today” do you hear yourself?
[30/07/2025, 15.59.22] Yousif Zaid: As you said, don’t be daft
[30/07/2025, 15.59.43] Yousif Zaid: don’t be sorry, I’ll hear from you when I hear from you
[30/07/2025, 21.27.23] Ems : Ok so last night was actually quite nice, an aunt brought two brooches for Marta and I that belonged to my great grandma
The two uncles were really funny as well
[30/07/2025, 21.27.29] Ems : So it was pleasant
[30/07/2025, 21.27.41] Ems : And today for lunch we got Roman food
[30/07/2025, 21.27.50] Ems : So overall it was nice
[30/07/2025, 21.29.05] Ems : Also random fact, I was tired when I got home from Greece and threw my jumper in the washing machine without realising that my airpods were in there. Somehow they survived? I'm not sure how that happened
[30/07/2025, 23.34.33] Yousif Zaid: That’s so sweet I’ve never even seen a broach in real life. Uncles are always funny I can’t wait to be an uncle
[30/07/2025, 23.34.54] Yousif Zaid: What is Roman food specifically?
[30/07/2025, 23.35.06] Yousif Zaid: That’s a miracle
[30/07/2025, 23.44.59] Yousif Zaid: Can I see your broach?
[30/07/2025, 23.45.36] Yousif Zaid: It was lots of fun! Me and mitya showed up early and made friends with a Chinese woman named Cilly and she spent the rest of the evening hanging out with us
[30/07/2025, 23.47.01] Yousif Zaid: Beers and smokes and then a kebab. Standard night out. Soheyl brought out a friend of his from work named Nikos. He had earrings that were shaped like popcorn on, and it made me think of how much you love popcorn
[31/07/2025, 09.02.28] Ems : Well there's 4 main pastas, and that's what the adults got, but Marta and I got some meant dishes, one was like filled meatballs with mortadella in tomato sauce and the other was chicken thighs in pepper sauce
[31/07/2025, 09.02.35] Ems : image omitted
[31/07/2025, 09.03.12] Ems : These are the two, she said to choose between us which if the two we wanted and Marta said I should have green since it's my favourite colour
[31/07/2025, 09.03.34] Ems : I think the flower shape is prettier but i do love green so I don't mind
[31/07/2025, 09.04.43] Ems : The night out actually sounds really nice, it's been a while. I can just see you and Dimitri just randomly making friends with Cilly
[31/07/2025, 09.05.23] Ems : Also popcorn earrings is such a cool thing to have
[31/07/2025, 09.05.49] Ems : Even if you didn't go to bootleggers you still had popcorn somehow this way
[31/07/2025, 09.06.16] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 09.10.49] Ems : Ohh did you start yet?
[31/07/2025, 09.52.53] Yousif Zaid: No the point of the image was “hold on I’ll reply when it won’t kill me”
[31/07/2025, 09.53.14] Yousif Zaid: The green one suits your eyes better I think
[31/07/2025, 09.53.43] Yousif Zaid: I was smoking and he whipped out a thing of bubbles and started blowing bubbles and I decided it was time to make a new friend so I introduced myself to Cilly
[31/07/2025, 10.19.23] Ems : Why tf are you holding up the book then
[31/07/2025, 10.19.45] Yousif Zaid: Meow
[31/07/2025, 10.19.49] Ems : This is an interaction I've seen a hundred times
[31/07/2025, 10.20.14] Ems : HAHAHAJAJAHAHA
[31/07/2025, 10.20.30] Yousif Zaid: I was giggling as I hit send
[31/07/2025, 10.20.43] Yousif Zaid: “Right well he’s a lunatic time to make a new friend”
[31/07/2025, 10.24.03] Ems : Your exact thought process
[31/07/2025, 10.24.22] Ems : In the end instead of going to Albania with Marta were taking a family trip to Ventotene
[31/07/2025, 10.24.26] Ems : We're in the car
[31/07/2025, 11.10.19] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 11.10.29] Yousif Zaid: What the fuck man this place is gorgeous
[31/07/2025, 11.10.54] Yousif Zaid: Oh if I went there I’d totally try to walk around the whole place
[31/07/2025, 12.25.39] Ems : Yes
[31/07/2025, 12.25.51] Ems : I know I'm really happy
[31/07/2025, 12.26.05] Ems : I'm planning to, you know how I am
[31/07/2025, 12.28.42] Yousif Zaid: It should only be like 8 km
[31/07/2025, 12.30.26] Ems : The only problem could be the heat, but I'll give it a shot
[31/07/2025, 12.30.35] Ems : 8km is really doable
[31/07/2025, 12.30.41] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 12.30.44] Yousif Zaid: Fuck yeah
[31/07/2025, 12.31.18] Ems : This is so badass
[31/07/2025, 12.40.43] Yousif Zaid: I got into an argument with my coworkers I said like “I’d have painted the dragon red” and nobody was on my side
[31/07/2025, 12.40.50] Yousif Zaid: Imagine a dragon, its red isn’t it
[31/07/2025, 13.23.01] Ems : Yeah true
[31/07/2025, 13.23.10] Ems : Cause fire and shit
[31/07/2025, 13.23.12] Ems : But
[31/07/2025, 13.23.21] Ems : How to train your dragon
[31/07/2025, 13.23.28] Yousif Zaid: They said the same thing
[31/07/2025, 13.23.31] Yousif Zaid: For fucks sake
[31/07/2025, 13.23.49] Yousif Zaid: Singapore won’t work btw , or at least I don’t think so
[31/07/2025, 13.24.15] Yousif Zaid: Hong Kong is the next hope
[31/07/2025, 13.27.56] Yousif Zaid: Fuck me HKU doesn’t work either
[31/07/2025, 13.33.56] Ems : How come, are the courses not there?
[31/07/2025, 13.50.50] Yousif Zaid: Not during fall
[31/07/2025, 13.50.58] Yousif Zaid: And there’s scheduling conflicts
[31/07/2025, 13.51.10] Yousif Zaid: I’m trying to rearrange my study plan to make this work. It’s a complete nightmare
[31/07/2025, 14.56.23] Ems : That sucks are there no Asian options left??
[31/07/2025, 14.56.49] Yousif Zaid: I rearranged my shit and now I’m taking num algos with Jaap this fall
[31/07/2025, 14.57.03] Yousif Zaid: Cornell still works (god bless Ithaca), now I’m checking NUS
[31/07/2025, 14.57.24] Yousif Zaid: I found all the courses I need but now I’m trying to figure out the schedules
[31/07/2025, 14.57.37] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 15.09.06] Ems : You're very brave wanting to go to the us
[31/07/2025, 15.09.45] Yousif Zaid: On account of being brown or?
[31/07/2025, 15.13.46] Ems : I'm so confused
[31/07/2025, 15.14.28] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 15.39.50] Ems : Just on account of being a human
[31/07/2025, 15.39.58] Ems : I wouldn't want to go right now
[31/07/2025, 15.40.13] Yousif Zaid: Hopefully it’s fine in a year
[31/07/2025, 15.40.25] Yousif Zaid: I’m listening to our playlist and mr brightside came on and I started laughing
[31/07/2025, 15.40.37] Yousif Zaid: I was like “this has to be emma’s doing”
[31/07/2025, 15.40.44] Ems : Maybe? Perhaps if you send an email they make an exception
[31/07/2025, 15.41.02] Yousif Zaid: I asked them
[31/07/2025, 16.46.41] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[31/07/2025, 16.47.11] Yousif Zaid: Embarrassing things are happening in the guys group chat
[31/07/2025, 16.52.34] Ems : Hahahahahahahaha It was but they asked me to play it on the boat

[31/07/2025, 16.52.51] Ems : Ok let's see
[31/07/2025, 16.53.15] Ems : I knew Abid was a real one
[31/07/2025, 16.53.25] Yousif Zaid: There’s no way you’re on his side
[31/07/2025, 16.54.13] Yousif Zaid: Am I really meant to pay 1000 dkk to see benson Boone
[31/07/2025, 16.54.24] Yousif Zaid: I paid 700 for the fucking weeknd
[31/07/2025, 16.54.36] Ems : I'm joking but I think he might be as well
[31/07/2025, 16.54.59] Yousif Zaid: I’m really not so sure anymore Abid is a bit of a nutcase
[31/07/2025, 16.55.01] Ems : It's value for money if you get to see him just as he is on the album photo
[31/07/2025, 16.55.16] Yousif Zaid: Dirty smelly and wrapped in an American flag
[31/07/2025, 16.55.23] Yousif Zaid: Moustache hairs touching his upper lip
[31/07/2025, 16.57.08] Yousif Zaid: This is the least attractive thing any man can do I think
[31/07/2025, 16.58.10] Yousif Zaid: Every day I open my mailbox to nothing I take my phone out and write to my Greek friend Jim and tell him to kill himself
[31/07/2025, 17.00.15] Ems : You should pay the 1000 dkk
[31/07/2025, 17.00.51] Ems : Listen just thank god I remembered to take pictures of it
[31/07/2025, 17.00.53] Ems : Otherwise you would have never seen it
[31/07/2025, 17.01.13] Yousif Zaid: I’m not giving up don’t worry I just like telling my Greek friend Jim to kill himself
[31/07/2025, 17.02.39] Yousif Zaid: I logged 120 hours worked this month #SummerHoliday
[31/07/2025, 17.12.30] Ems : Let me know what the time frame is for the giving up
[31/07/2025, 17.12.44] Yousif Zaid: My arrival in Bologna
[31/07/2025, 17.12.43] Ems : I know it's bad if you're using hashtags
[31/07/2025, 17.12.58] Ems : Like you must be going crazy
[31/07/2025, 17.13.08] Yousif Zaid: My dad travelled to Egypt today
[31/07/2025, 17.13.38] Ems : At that point just read it straight from my phone
[31/07/2025, 17.13.39] Ems : So you're home alone?
[31/07/2025, 17.13.49] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 17.14.52] Ems : The celebrity appearance in the photo isn't you, it's the couch I patched up
[31/07/2025, 17.15.14] Yousif Zaid: Two more days of this and I’m gonna start talking to the couch
[31/07/2025, 17.15.45] Yousif Zaid: Also the photo is meant to show that I am indeed home alone
[31/07/2025, 17.16.00] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know what to do. Drink beer? Cook? Go gym?
[31/07/2025, 17.16.23] Ems : No I realised
[31/07/2025, 17.16.37] Ems : I just wanted to appreciate my work
[31/07/2025, 17.16.55] Yousif Zaid: I appreciate it whenever I use the couch
[31/07/2025, 17.17.02] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/07/2025, 17.17.07] Yousif Zaid: Opening up a bit though
[31/07/2025, 17.17.26] Ems : I say not beer? Maybe go sailing with dimi
[31/07/2025, 17.17.52] Yousif Zaid: What are you talking about do I just text him saying let’s go sailing
[31/07/2025, 17.17.54] Ems : This is making me so sad it's devastating
[31/07/2025, 17.18.13] Yousif Zaid: You can always sew it up some more
[31/07/2025, 17.18.29] Ems : Yeah why not a day out at sea sounds good, drink beer there it's better
[31/07/2025, 17.18.42] Ems : True
[31/07/2025, 17.18.46] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know if I have it in me
[31/07/2025, 17.18.54] Yousif Zaid: Maybe I host a barbecue
[31/07/2025, 17.18.59] Ems : I really remembered doing a better job
[31/07/2025, 17.19.12] Ems : YES
[31/07/2025, 17.19.13] Ems : And do a really fancy side dish
[31/07/2025, 17.19.21] Yousif Zaid: You did do a better job I’ve just been laying on the couch and messing it up
[31/07/2025, 17.19.27] Ems : Yeah you do it's fun
[31/07/2025, 17.19.37] Yousif Zaid: Boat talk :/
[31/07/2025, 17.20.26] Ems : Not interested in carbon sails?
[31/07/2025, 17.20.58] Yousif Zaid: Absentmindedly drinking rum while hearing talk of carbon fibre underpants
[31/07/2025, 17.21.06] Yousif Zaid: Hoping the sea will take me
[31/07/2025, 17.33.59] Yousif Zaid: I remembered this book I read in middle school: “After the Fire”
[31/07/2025, 17.34.27] Yousif Zaid: It’s about this girl who tells her life story as a cult survivor to a therapist, I thought it was very good at the time, but I gave the book to a friend
[31/07/2025, 17.41.13] Ems : Dream holiday. Is that how that day went when I wasn't there?
[31/07/2025, 17.41.14] Ems : I did read it
[31/07/2025, 17.41.16] Ems : Somebody lent it to me
[31/07/2025, 17.41.17] Ems : It was quite good
[31/07/2025, 17.42.04] Yousif Zaid: Something like that. It’s strange because it was a good time and I appreciated it but at the same time you’re just so happy to come home
[31/07/2025, 18.37.16] Ems : Yeah I get that
[31/07/2025, 18.38.22] Ems : I went for such a nice swim
[31/07/2025, 18.44.05] Ems : video omitted
[31/07/2025, 19.14.27] Yousif Zaid: That looks very lovely. When did you guys get to the island?
[31/07/2025, 19.15.11] Yousif Zaid: I’ve decided that I’m going to properly pack my gym bag, go there and hit the saunas afterwards, and buy dinner on the way home. Then I drink beer in my living room while reading the silent patient
[31/07/2025, 21.58.30] Ems : At 4pm
[31/07/2025, 21.58.37] Ems : How was the gym?
[31/07/2025, 21.59.51] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[31/07/2025, 22.00.05] Yousif Zaid: This just fucking happened I’m on my way home from the restaurant I went to after the gym
[31/07/2025, 22.07.44] Yousif Zaid: Gym was great. Did a horrible leg day, won’t be able to walk tommorow. Discussed essential oils with old naked men in the sauna
[31/07/2025, 22.08.07] Yousif Zaid: Hadn’t eaten literally all day so dinner was a chicken and rice bowl and a sandwich
[31/07/2025, 22.41.40] Ems : I have no clue what you're talking about because this island has terrible connection and the house doesn't have WiFi so the video doesn't load
[31/07/2025, 22.41.50] Ems : That sounds really nice
[31/07/2025, 22.42.13] Yousif Zaid: Youll like the video when it does load
[31/07/2025, 22.42.20] Ems : Except for the not eating part hahahahahaha
[31/07/2025, 22.42.42] Yousif Zaid: I can’t explain it I’m just not so hungry early in the day recently
[31/07/2025, 22.49.25] Ems : I can't wait
[31/07/2025, 22.49.33] Ems : Maybe in three days
[31/07/2025, 22.49.48] Ems : I tried loading it and it said 12+ hours
[31/07/2025, 22.49.50] Ems : That's fair enough
[31/07/2025, 22.50.07] Yousif Zaid: I’m kind of enjoying myself alone in the house
[31/07/2025, 22.50.22] Yousif Zaid: This is fun. John invited me over for dinner tommorow. Said he’s making fish pies
[31/07/2025, 23.02.52] Ems : Are you doing karaoke alone?
[31/07/2025, 23.03.18] Ems : Uhh that's so nice and very British
[31/07/2025, 23.03.23] Ems : Wow
[31/07/2025, 23.03.24] Yousif Zaid: Sitting in the living room with a drink and a book
[31/07/2025, 23.03.35] Ems : You should see how he makes them to recreate
[31/07/2025, 23.03.50] Yousif Zaid: I’m happy he’s the one cooking, his wife is unfortunately not very culinarily inclined
[31/07/2025, 23.06.34] Ems : You told me, giving food in single use plates means she really can't cook for shit
[31/07/2025, 23.06.54] Yousif Zaid: How do you fuck up banana bread
[01/08/2025, 08.48.07] Ems : There's talent in that as well really
[01/08/2025, 09.22.25] Yousif Zaid: My tummy hurts
[01/08/2025, 09.37.58] Ems : How come what happened?
[01/08/2025, 09.39.52] Ems : video omitted
[01/08/2025, 09.46.20] Yousif Zaid: Probably the 2 kilos of food I consumed right before bedtime yesterday
[01/08/2025, 09.46.47] Yousif Zaid: Looks beautiful, have you had a chance to walk around the island yet? You should take Marta with you
[01/08/2025, 09.58.33] Ems : Call it post gym fuel
[01/08/2025, 09.59.01] Ems : I've walked around loads but I'm not sure if there's a good chance to do a full loop
[01/08/2025, 09.59.07] Ems : Maybe first thing in the morning
[01/08/2025, 09.59.20] Yousif Zaid: Surely you can find some time, how long are yall there
[01/08/2025, 10.00.23] Yousif Zaid: I’m currently listening to some Egyptian-Libyan funk pop, it’s gas

[01/08/2025, 11.10.35] Ems : video omitted
[01/08/2025, 11.10.46] Ems : I'd stopped reading blood meridian for a few days but I'm really getting back into it
[01/08/2025, 11.11.10] Ems : Are you at work today or is it a rest day?
[01/08/2025, 11.11.56] Yousif Zaid: It’s a very sweet song
[01/08/2025, 11.12.17] Yousif Zaid: I’m really looking forward to seeing your reactions
[01/08/2025, 11.12.31] Yousif Zaid: Whenever some crazy shit happens just text me your reaction
[01/08/2025, 11.12.35] Yousif Zaid: Work! No days off
[01/08/2025, 11.17.14] Yousif Zaid: They have chained to the fucking reception here
[01/08/2025, 11.26.53] Ems : I will, the fortune teller is doing her thing right now
[01/08/2025, 11.27.03] Ems : At least you can read this way
[01/08/2025, 11.36.50] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[01/08/2025, 12.31.59] Ems : image omitted

[01/08/2025, 12.58.32] Yousif Zaid: Me and Laura are having a movie night today
[01/08/2025, 14.08.31] Ems : I laughed so hard with the danish names
[01/08/2025, 14.08.36] Ems : Completely unpronounceable
[01/08/2025, 14.08.42] Ems : What are you guys watching?
[01/08/2025, 14.08.52] Yousif Zaid: That’s her choice
[01/08/2025, 14.10.33] Yousif Zaid: I have never bothered to defend the Danish language
[01/08/2025, 14.28.10] Ems : The names they put on cans in Italy are really biblical
[01/08/2025, 14.28.32] Yousif Zaid: I’d drink a coke with Jesus
[01/08/2025, 14.28.58] Ems : Marta and I both got names of apostles on our cans
[01/08/2025, 14.29.26] Yousif Zaid: I wonder what they’re like in the Middle East
[01/08/2025, 14.29.31] Yousif Zaid: Have a coke with Muhammed
[01/08/2025, 14.30.30] Yousif Zaid: What are you guys doing on the island anyhow
[01/08/2025, 14.42.43] Ems : We went swimming and had a really nice lunch I had octopus it was great
[01/08/2025, 14.43.15] Ems : Then we're going to a museum
[01/08/2025, 14.43.17] Ems : For sure
[01/08/2025, 15.27.59] Yousif Zaid: I’ve only had octopus once and it was like a pencil eraser made of fish. Maybe the Greek just can’t make octopus
[01/08/2025, 15.28.19] Yousif Zaid: I’m going to take a nap in the living room
[01/08/2025, 16.53.28] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[01/08/2025, 17.13.03] Ems : I love octopus it's one of my favourite things

[01/08/2025, 18.17.54] Yousif Zaid: Tulips were your favourite weren’t they?
[01/08/2025, 18.48.50] Ems : Sorry obviously I didn't get the message
[01/08/2025, 18.50.17] Ems : Sunflowers are probably my favourite, tulips are always very pretty though

[01/08/2025, 19.20.22] Ems : I'm stupid
[01/08/2025, 19.23.18] Ems : video omitted
[01/08/2025, 19.24.14] Ems : It's really interesting but the guide is fully keeping us from dinner
[02/08/2025, 01.20.22] Yousif Zaid: hello ems, sorry i didn't reply, have been quite preoccupied
[02/08/2025, 01.20.35] Yousif Zaid: this is very beautiful
[02/08/2025, 01.21.23] Yousif Zaid: After fish pie and G&T with John, I went to pick up laura. Said hi to her folks and drove her back here. We went shopping for movie snacks and chocolate milk (she doesn't drink alcohol, anything carbonated, tea or coffee), and I gave her the tea cups.
[02/08/2025, 01.21.56] Yousif Zaid: We joined John and his wife for beers, chocolate milk, cake and crisps in their yard, and a cigarette for dessert
[02/08/2025, 01.22.34] Yousif Zaid: We parted ways and me and laura ended up watching Moulin Rouge. It was quite funny because i didn't care for the film very much but laura bawled her eyes out. she's currently weeping in my kitchen i think
[02/08/2025, 01.23.44] Yousif Zaid: What was for dinner? On the way back to my place i stopped at an italian Deli to buy laura a sandwich for dinner, and i bought myself a little Aranchini that had eggplant and cheese and tomatoes in it. fucking delicious
[02/08/2025, 01.24.19] Yousif Zaid: When laura comes back from crying in the kitchen i'll probably gossip with her about things. She took my advice and now officially has a girlfriend, which makes me very happy for her
[02/08/2025, 01.24.50] Yousif Zaid: Here she comes, look forward to hearing from you tommorow, goodnight!
[02/08/2025, 07.40.51] Ems : Sounds like a very good night
[02/08/2025, 07.41.22] Ems : Do not worry I didn't have any connection last night from 8pm

[02/08/2025, 11.05.36] Yousif Zaid: That’s just Felix’s side profile isn’t it

[02/08/2025, 16.08.36] Ems : Oh you're kind of right
[02/08/2025, 16.08.56] Ems : If you look at the other rock as well it looks like a giant coming out if the water
[02/08/2025, 16.09.10] Ems : The other rock is the knee
[02/08/2025, 16.09.44] Ems : At noon?!
[02/08/2025, 17.27.09] Yousif Zaid: Felix is kind of like a giant
[02/08/2025, 17.27.39] Yousif Zaid: Two gap years [02/08/2025, 17.28.04] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[02/08/2025, 19.51.17] Ems : Istg
[02/08/2025, 20.53.06] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[02/08/2025, 20.53.52] Yousif Zaid: All good, when the boys go home tonight I’ll start the silent patient
[02/08/2025, 23.15.04] Ems : The phone still isn't working so the image won't load but from what I can see it looks great I sent a video at like 5pm and it hasn't sent so it'll probably arrive in like 5 days
[02/08/2025, 23.36.33] Yousif Zaid: God speed
[02/08/2025, 23.36.42] Yousif Zaid: Maybe letter arrives before the video

[03/08/2025, 02.01.32] Ems : This is the only picture I have because you know how my phone is
[03/08/2025, 02.01.51] Yousif Zaid: Ems nothing is arriving
[03/08/2025, 02.18.58] Yousif Zaid: We can pick this back up when you’re back in civilisation

[03/08/2025, 07.08.31] Ems : I'll be home later today
[03/08/2025, 07.08.57] Ems : Thing is the island is not deserted so I think the locals just have access to a shit ton of wifi
[03/08/2025, 07.09.16] Ems : Also phones work in the morning maybe because not many people are using internet

[03/08/2025, 07.10.38] Ems : Did you guys have fun?
[03/08/2025, 07.39.26] Yousif Zaid: I woke up early to vacuum the house and pick up my mom from the airport, haven’t seen her in a month and in a hurry, will reply ASAP
[03/08/2025, 07.39.39] Yousif Zaid: Will say that this is a very lovely photo
[03/08/2025, 08.07.17] Yousif Zaid: The hair clip, the earring, the sun, it looks great
[03/08/2025, 09.30.39] Yousif Zaid: Sitting in the airport parking lot
[03/08/2025, 09.30.56] Yousif Zaid: Basically the boys and I did this yesterday but much much less classy
[03/08/2025, 09.31.12] Yousif Zaid: Poor you, 6 bottles of water
[03/08/2025, 09.31.57] Yousif Zaid: So much fun, we drank and made burgers and then they wanted to box me a little in my living room
[03/08/2025, 09.32.35] Yousif Zaid: Then we watched the big lebowski (greatest comedy movie ever we have to watch it) and sat on my porch and smoked til about 2
[03/08/2025, 09.32.42] Yousif Zaid: Louis stayed the night
[03/08/2025, 14.31.39] Ems : Say hi to her from me
[03/08/2025, 14.31.57] Ems : Fuck off it was uphill and hot
[03/08/2025, 14.32.37] Ems : That sounds like the perfect you night
[03/08/2025, 14.32.37] Ems : So many people staying over
[03/08/2025, 14.32.38] Ems : I'm officially on the mainland it feels weird
[03/08/2025, 14.32.57] Yousif Zaid: It felt lonely in the house I had to make it work somehow
[03/08/2025, 14.33.33] Yousif Zaid: I will once she wakes up from her jet lag nap
[03/08/2025, 14.33.46] Yousif Zaid: She brought me some presents from America
[03/08/2025, 14.34.02] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 14.34.29] Ems : Yousif this is so cute
[03/08/2025, 14.34.33] Ems : She know you well
[03/08/2025, 14.34.48] Ems : Knows*
[03/08/2025, 14.34.49] Yousif Zaid: I went complete child mode
[03/08/2025, 14.35.06] Yousif Zaid: I also got some belts and a cool belt buckle
[03/08/2025, 14.36.45] Yousif Zaid: You not happy to be back? Wanted to stay in ponza a bit longer?
[03/08/2025, 14.37.01] Ems : Send the photos
[03/08/2025, 14.37.11] Yousif Zaid: They’re all really stupid
[03/08/2025, 14.37.26] Ems : I was in ventotene I'm going to ponza on the 7th with a friend
[03/08/2025, 14.37.36] Ems : But actually it was the perfect little vacation
[03/08/2025, 14.37.47] Yousif Zaid: A vacation within a vacation
[03/08/2025, 14.38.17] Ems : Summer is hard I needed a break
[03/08/2025, 14.38.25] Ems : By the way I was reading on the ferry
[03/08/2025, 14.38.32] Ems : And poor native Americans
[03/08/2025, 14.38.37] Ems : They slaughtered them
[03/08/2025, 14.38.38] Yousif Zaid: Ahahhahahahahahahahahahha
[03/08/2025, 14.39.06] Ems : The two infants being crushed on the rocks one in each hand
[03/08/2025, 14.39.21] Ems : I was frowning the whole journey
[03/08/2025, 14.39.25] Ems : And I winced
[03/08/2025, 14.39.52] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 14.40.33] Yousif Zaid: The prose itself is somehow still pretty
[03/08/2025, 14.40.35] Ems : I winced and audibly exhaled
[03/08/2025, 14.40.42] Ems : It's absolutely beautiful
[03/08/2025, 14.40.46] Ems : The descriptions as well
[03/08/2025, 14.40.51] Ems : It's never boring
[03/08/2025, 14.41.05] Yousif Zaid: Now comes the question, how involved was the kid in this, in your mind
[03/08/2025, 14.41.07] Ems : Also the judge is a piece of shit but I kind of like him
[03/08/2025, 14.41.34] Ems : Good question
[03/08/2025, 14.41.40] Yousif Zaid: He’s a great character but “piece of shit” is an understatement. Some people read him as like, satan personified
[03/08/2025, 14.44.15] Ems : I think quite a lot
[03/08/2025, 14.44.18] Ems : Exactly
[03/08/2025, 14.44.19] Ems : When Tobin describes him it really shows
[03/08/2025, 14.44.21] Ems : Also the fact that the first thing he does is get a priest killed
[03/08/2025, 14.44.35] Yousif Zaid: Yeah? I’m a bit more optimistic
[03/08/2025, 14.45.19] Yousif Zaid: I like to think that he’s still a scalp hunting mercenary but shoots armed natives only. It’s still bad but the kid in my mind doesn’t go for women and children
[03/08/2025, 14.45.48] Ems : Ok
[03/08/2025, 14.45.59] Ems : I'll finish the book before giving my final thoughts
[03/08/2025, 14.46.18] Yousif Zaid: There’s no right and wrong I have no basis for my opinion that I could possibly spoil
[03/08/2025, 14.46.19] Ems : But I think the kid is meant to show that humans aren't good even as young
[03/08/2025, 14.46.34] Ems : No I see what you mean
[03/08/2025, 14.46.51] Ems : It's just I need the big picture
[03/08/2025, 14.46.51] Yousif Zaid: It’s done on purpose it kind of lets you have your own protagonist in your head
[03/08/2025, 14.46.58] Yousif Zaid: Yes yes
[03/08/2025, 14.47.10] Ems : The book is so good I'm really glad you lent it
[03/08/2025, 14.47.14] Yousif Zaid: I think it’s very cool. Tell me did you get to the part where they bought pistols?
[03/08/2025, 14.47.22] Yousif Zaid: You must have
[03/08/2025, 14.47.35] Ems : It's been to Greece and ventotene already
[03/08/2025, 14.47.52] Ems : The one where the captain shoots all the animals
[03/08/2025, 14.47.53] Yousif Zaid: I only took it to dtu building 423 and the 300s bus
[03/08/2025, 14.48.13] Yousif Zaid: It’s difficult to quote novels but I remember something along the lines of “A cat disappearing into nothingness”
[03/08/2025, 14.48.50] Ems : Yes I remember I was at a loss for words
[03/08/2025, 14.49.11] Yousif Zaid: Suck a weird book man
[03/08/2025, 14.49.25] Yousif Zaid: John recommended “Heart of Darkness” to me
[03/08/2025, 14.50.16] Ems : Is it along the lines of blood meridian?
[03/08/2025, 14.50.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s about an army sailor who is tasked with hunting down a captain who has gone mad and started an extremist group during the slaughters in the Belgian Congo
[03/08/2025, 14.51.29] Yousif Zaid: It’s more similar to blood meridian than it is to pride and prejudice or little women I imagine
[03/08/2025, 14.52.34] Ems : Yeah it doesn't sound much like wuthering heights
[03/08/2025, 14.52.50] Ems : Random question
[03/08/2025, 14.53.03] Ems : Do you know what day our last exam is going to be?
[03/08/2025, 14.53.17] Yousif Zaid: Our last exam…. Ever?
[03/08/2025, 14.53.23] Yousif Zaid: Depends when you take your masters degree
[03/08/2025, 14.53.27] Ems : This December
[03/08/2025, 14.53.30] Yousif Zaid: Oh
[03/08/2025, 14.53.31] Ems : ..
[03/08/2025, 14.53.49] Yousif Zaid: What courses do you have? I can find out for you
[03/08/2025, 14.55.53] Ems : image omitted
[03/08/2025, 14.56.06] Ems : Because Marta's 18th birthday is on the 20th
[03/08/2025, 14.56.09] Ems : Thank you
[03/08/2025, 14.56.23] Yousif Zaid: Ewwwwwwwww what
[03/08/2025, 14.56.55] Yousif Zaid: Here btw
[03/08/2025, 14.57.08] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 14.57.08] Ems : Right
[03/08/2025, 14.57.08] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 14.57.09] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 14.57.29] Yousif Zaid: I was pretending to be a cowboy
[03/08/2025, 14.58.35] Ems : THEY ARE SO COOL
[03/08/2025, 14.59.10] Ems : You could be in the tavern with a glass of whiskey for all I know
[03/08/2025, 14.59.50] Yousif Zaid: You would make a very good kindergarten teacher ems
[03/08/2025, 15.00.52] Ems : You say that because you don't hear the sarcasm
[03/08/2025, 15.00.59] Ems : Also I don't know how to take that
[03/08/2025, 15.01.13] Yousif Zaid: No I do but children can’t detect it
[03/08/2025, 15.01.32] Yousif Zaid: As the compliment I mean it to be. I couldn’t be a kindergarten teacher
[03/08/2025, 15.02.17] Ems : True I could be insulting them and they'd never know
[03/08/2025, 15.02.42] Ems : You would make a good one except if they said or did something stupid
[03/08/2025, 15.02.48] Ems : Then you'd just stare at them
[03/08/2025, 15.03.49] Yousif Zaid: “Why the fuck are you crying because you’re tired just sleep”
[03/08/2025, 15.03.55] Yousif Zaid: “Yousif don’t swear at them”
[03/08/2025, 15.05.08] Ems : But let's be honest I wouldn't be good at it. I'd get annoyed and look at them with repulsion
[03/08/2025, 15.05.14] Ems : And then walk out
[03/08/2025, 15.07.37] Ems : No what the fuck the judge is disgusting
[03/08/2025, 15.07.57] Ems : He took care of the boy just to kill and scalp him
[03/08/2025, 15.11.02] Yousif Zaid: Ems I’m pretty sure he sexually abused him as well
[03/08/2025, 15.11.21] Ems : Yeah I got that I'm disgusted
[03/08/2025, 15.11.42] Yousif Zaid: He’s not really human is he
[03/08/2025, 15.11.51] Yousif Zaid: Did you get a physical description of him yet
[03/08/2025, 15.12.09] Ems : Yes
[03/08/2025, 15.12.25] Ems : I'm just a bit upset right now
[03/08/2025, 15.12.43] Ems : He's a very well written character I'll give him that
[03/08/2025, 15.13.00] Yousif Zaid: See I would tell you it’s not real but
[03/08/2025, 15.13.11] Yousif Zaid: It’s based on a journal kept by the real Glanton
[03/08/2025, 15.23.04] Yousif Zaid: I’m ashamed to report that I’m in a bookstore. An Arabic mom called out to her toddler
[03/08/2025, 15.23.10] Yousif Zaid: “Yousif it’s time to go!”
[03/08/2025, 15.23.24] Yousif Zaid: And I turned around looked her dead in the face and said “where?”
[03/08/2025, 16.18.06] Ems : Hahahahahshahahaha
[03/08/2025, 16.18.06] Ems : To be completely fair it's a very honest mistake
Like I would probably do the same
[03/08/2025, 16.18.29] Yousif Zaid: She said it in baby talk man
[03/08/2025, 16.18.53] Yousif Zaid: The silent patient is a bit funny
[03/08/2025, 16.19.10] Yousif Zaid: The plot is very good so I’m enjoying it
[03/08/2025, 16.19.44] Yousif Zaid: But the prose is like 50% nice and 50% “im 14 and I think I’m deep”
[03/08/2025, 16.21.06] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes it’s pretty neat and at other times it’s like reading the diary of a 13 year old boy who got dumped at his middle school prom
[03/08/2025, 16.21.12] Ems : I did say it's been a while
[03/08/2025, 16.21.17] Ems : But stick with it
[03/08/2025, 16.21.21] Ems : Really
[03/08/2025, 16.21.29] Yousif Zaid: I’m telling you I enjoy it
[03/08/2025, 16.24.35] Yousif Zaid: “Somehow grasping at vanishing snowflakes is like grasping at happiness, an act of possession which instantly gives way to nothing”
[03/08/2025, 16.24.51] Yousif Zaid: The architect guy at bootleggers with the cigarette in his ear wrote this
[03/08/2025, 16.25.14] Yousif Zaid: His favourite animal is a golden retriever puppy dog
[03/08/2025, 16.26.09] Yousif Zaid: But then we have great sentences like “As human beings, our earliest years reside in a land before memory. We like to think of ourselves as emerging from this primordial fog with our characters fully formed, like Aphrodite rising perfect from the sea foam”
[03/08/2025, 16.26.21] Yousif Zaid: This is super pretty
[03/08/2025, 16.29.07] Yousif Zaid: “We’re all crazy I believe, just in different ways” shut up man
[03/08/2025, 16.29.28] Ems : Yeah you're right this is nice
[03/08/2025, 16.30.01] Ems : Yousif remind me to answer you once you finish the book ok?
[03/08/2025, 16.30.20] Yousif Zaid: Did I make an oopsie
[03/08/2025, 16.30.39] Yousif Zaid: But yes
[03/08/2025, 16.30.56] Ems : Nono you're good just remind me
[03/08/2025, 16.31.13] Yousif Zaid: Give me two days
[03/08/2025, 16.56.08] Yousif Zaid: My mom says “give emma my warm regards”, that’s translated from Arabic
[03/08/2025, 17.01.16] Yousif Zaid: It’s less formal than it sounds
[03/08/2025, 21.27.49] Ems : Okkk you don't have to speed read but this is an easy one I think
[03/08/2025, 21.28.22] Yousif Zaid: You’re right. A third of the way done
[03/08/2025, 21.28.42] Yousif Zaid: I just wondered, does your mom know I exist?
[03/08/2025, 21.29.06] Ems : Hahahahahahahaha
[03/08/2025, 21.29.08] Ems : She does
[03/08/2025, 21.29.43] Ems : First of all because I tell her about my life, secondly because you're coming to Italy
[03/08/2025, 21.29.45] Ems : Why?
[03/08/2025, 21.31.30] Yousif Zaid: When I’m excited to do something or go somewhere I imagine what it might be like
[03/08/2025, 21.32.00] Yousif Zaid: What your house looks like, what the pool will smell like, that kinda stuff
[03/08/2025, 21.32.34] Yousif Zaid: So I wondered what it would be like to meet your folks and what impression of me they might already have
[03/08/2025, 21.47.11] Ems : I obviously only said good things so a very good impression. The pool smells like salt since this year when we switched from chlorine if you're wondering
[03/08/2025, 21.47.30] Ems : Did the letter arrive??
[03/08/2025, 21.47.41] Yousif Zaid: It’s a Saturday ems
[03/08/2025, 21.48.05] Yousif Zaid: Let me check for completeness sake
[03/08/2025, 21.48.32] Ems : It's Sunday yuyu
[03/08/2025, 21.48.38] Yousif Zaid: Woah
[03/08/2025, 21.48.52] Yousif Zaid: I haven’t done anything of use today
[03/08/2025, 21.49.49] Yousif Zaid: I hope I can live up to it. I wonder what bad things you left out
[03/08/2025, 21.49.57] Yousif Zaid: “He twists our friend Dimitri’s nipples a lot”
[03/08/2025, 21.51.45] Ems : Well I left out the smoking that's for sure
[03/08/2025, 21.51.55] Yousif Zaid: Also this I hope
[03/08/2025, 21.52.54] Yousif Zaid: Have you?
[03/08/2025, 21.59.07] Ems : Well I've read quite a bit and I've cooked sheet pan kebabs
[03/08/2025, 21.59.18] Ems : So no but I've also travelled home
[03/08/2025, 22.03.03] Yousif Zaid: I’ve read a bit too. Picked my mom up in the morning, she napped for like 5 hours. The mailbox is empty by the way. I’m sure it’ll come this week
[03/08/2025, 22.19.55] Ems : It probably won't to be honest
[03/08/2025, 22.20.02] Ems : I sent it from mitika
[03/08/2025, 22.20.31] Yousif Zaid: Come on don’t lose hope
[03/08/2025, 22.20.52] Ems : You should've seen the post office
[03/08/2025, 22.20.57] Ems : It was funny
[03/08/2025, 22.21.10] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 22.21.14] Yousif Zaid: Hmmmm
[03/08/2025, 22.21.26] Ems : Yeah
[03/08/2025, 22.21.28] Yousif Zaid: It’s not much further than Rome is
[03/08/2025, 22.21.39] Ems : It's not the distance
[03/08/2025, 22.21.42] Yousif Zaid: Paint me a picture
[03/08/2025, 22.22.16] Ems : Smallest post office you've ever seen with just an 80 year old man and so much stuff scattered about
[03/08/2025, 22.22.22] Ems : I don't know
[03/08/2025, 22.32.28] Yousif Zaid: You know there’s a nonzero chance he just dropped dead of old age the second you left
[03/08/2025, 22.33.29] Yousif Zaid: Did he seem lucid when you told him what you wanted?
[03/08/2025, 22.40.24] Ems : I thought so
[03/08/2025, 22.40.32] Ems : I can't be completely sure
[03/08/2025, 22.40.48] Yousif Zaid: I believe in him
[03/08/2025, 22.40.59] Yousif Zaid: His name is probably Nikos or Christos
[03/08/2025, 22.41.24] Yousif Zaid: And his last mortal act on this earth before he dropped dead was passing your letter into a slightly less drunk Greek person
[03/08/2025, 22.43.37] Ems : Poor Nikos
[03/08/2025, 22.43.38] Ems : It'll arrive
[03/08/2025, 22.43.39] Ems : Probably
[03/08/2025, 22.43.47] Yousif Zaid: It will
[03/08/2025, 22.43.53] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 22.44.03] Yousif Zaid: Settle an argument, what do you think of this teapot
[03/08/2025, 22.44.47] Ems : It's quite cute
[03/08/2025, 22.44.48] Ems : Why
[03/08/2025, 22.44.57] Yousif Zaid: My mom hates it but I love it
[03/08/2025, 22.45.07] Yousif Zaid: She doesn’t want it in the kitchen
[03/08/2025, 22.45.23] Ems : That's why it's outside
[03/08/2025, 22.45.31] Ems : Where did you buy it
[03/08/2025, 22.45.41] Yousif Zaid: My dad bought it from I don’t know where
[03/08/2025, 22.46.05] Yousif Zaid: I think she’s wrong the teapot is lovely and blue and her name is Sophie probably
[03/08/2025, 22.46.43] Ems : She does look like a sophie
[03/08/2025, 22.47.00] Ems : I'm a bit particular about teapots in general
[03/08/2025, 22.47.07] Yousif Zaid: Do tell
[03/08/2025, 22.47.17] Ems : This isn't my favorite but it's nice
[03/08/2025, 22.47.44] Ems : I wouldn't know how to describe it
[03/08/2025, 22.47.48] Ems : Let me think
[03/08/2025, 22.48.55] Ems : I don't like overly flowery ones, they should be simple and seem a bit old?
[03/08/2025, 22.49.02] Ems : Does that make sense
[03/08/2025, 22.49.17] Yousif Zaid: Well used, I see what you mean
[03/08/2025, 22.49.28] Ems : Exactly
[03/08/2025, 22.49.38] Yousif Zaid: A new and shiny one is like
[03/08/2025, 22.49.43] Yousif Zaid: Having a 30 year old grandma
[03/08/2025, 22.49.57] Yousif Zaid: Like what?
[03/08/2025, 22.54.15] Ems : That's a difficult question
[03/08/2025, 22.54.19] Ems : I'll search
[03/08/2025, 22.54.32] Yousif Zaid: What question
[03/08/2025, 22.54.45] Ems : What teapot
[03/08/2025, 22.54.47] Ems : .
[03/08/2025, 22.54.56] Yousif Zaid: Not what I meant but do your thing boss
[03/08/2025, 22.55.13] Yousif Zaid: It was hammering down this point
[03/08/2025, 22.55.27] Ems : Ohh okok
[03/08/2025, 22.55.52] Ems : Yeah I just think really flowery ones are tacky mainly
[03/08/2025, 22.55.59] Ems : That's the main point
[03/08/2025, 22.56.03] Yousif Zaid: What about flowery tea sets?
[03/08/2025, 22.56.08] Yousif Zaid: Like the cups and saucers
[03/08/2025, 22.56.24] Ems : A bit is fine but too flowery I don't know
[03/08/2025, 22.56.46] Yousif Zaid: Ours are very over the top sometimes in the Middle East
[03/08/2025, 22.56.50] Yousif Zaid: Gold accents and stuff
[03/08/2025, 22.57.06] Ems : But gold accents are nice
[03/08/2025, 22.57.13] Ems : image omitted
[03/08/2025, 22.57.28] Yousif Zaid: No that looks like cheap graphic design
[03/08/2025, 22.57.38] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 22.57.49] Ems : This is cute
[03/08/2025, 22.58.08] Ems : It doesn't look like it's trying too hard
[03/08/2025, 22.58.17] Yousif Zaid: Is demure the word?
[03/08/2025, 22.58.23] Ems : Mindful
[03/08/2025, 22.58.34] Yousif Zaid: By the way
[03/08/2025, 22.58.45] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 22.58.52] Yousif Zaid: The song from yesterday I mentioned
[03/08/2025, 22.59.18] Ems : Thank you I need a good song
[03/08/2025, 22.59.36] Yousif Zaid: Also Ayonha, if you remember
[03/08/2025, 22.59.42] Ems : I'll listen to it while I read
[03/08/2025, 23.00.14] Yousif Zaid: I’m cleaning my room but will read myself to sleep tonight. Probably can finish the silent patient by tommorow night at this pace, it’s a page turner
[03/08/2025, 23.00.22] Yousif Zaid: Kathy cheating on our boy made my stomach churn
[03/08/2025, 23.01.00] Ems : I'm trying not to react but it is a page turner
[03/08/2025, 23.01.14] Yousif Zaid: Poor boy
[03/08/2025, 23.01.19] Yousif Zaid: The emails are diabolical
[03/08/2025, 23.01.37] Ems : Do your thing I really want to see your reactions
[03/08/2025, 23.01.40] Yousif Zaid: If I saw a signed email from my wife of 9 years saying she was a slut for another man I would end up on the news
[03/08/2025, 23.01.55] Yousif Zaid: “Local man takes entire orphanage hostage”
[03/08/2025, 23.02.01] Yousif Zaid: “Seems to be upset about something”
[03/08/2025, 23.02.10] Ems : Oh that email will do it
[03/08/2025, 23.02.21] Ems : Kathy is a bitch
[03/08/2025, 23.02.33] Yousif Zaid: :(
[03/08/2025, 23.02.35] Ems : I won't say anything else
[03/08/2025, 23.02.42] Yousif Zaid: Please don’t
[03/08/2025, 23.03.28] Yousif Zaid: I also don’t know if I’m a dumb or what but a bone thin mental patient lady like Alicia beat the piss out of the protagonist Theo and I just don’t know how
[03/08/2025, 23.04.34] Ems : Yeah She does
[03/08/2025, 23.05.03] Yousif Zaid: Theo needs boxing lessons
[03/08/2025, 23.05.03] Ems : I can't reply because I don't want to give anything away
[03/08/2025, 23.05.37] Yousif Zaid: Even talking about Theo getting the dogshit beat out of him is spoiling? I gotta read this shit
[03/08/2025, 23.06.33] Ems : Meanwhile the Apaches are dying one by one
[03/08/2025, 23.06.57] Yousif Zaid: I’m so jealous of you that you’re reading it for the first time
[03/08/2025, 23.07.02] Ems : I keep pausing the book to search up the history
[03/08/2025, 23.07.28] Yousif Zaid: Here’s some cowboy songs
[03/08/2025, 23.07.32] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 23.07.50] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/08/2025, 23.08.14] Ems : This will actually give me the full experience while reading
[03/08/2025, 23.08.28] Yousif Zaid: “They rode on”
[03/08/2025, 23.09.10] Ems : It summarises the whole book basically
[03/08/2025, 23.09.25] Ems : Ok I'll go read and sleep
[03/08/2025, 23.09.32] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight ems
[03/08/2025, 23.09.39] Ems : Night yuyu
[04/08/2025, 09.41.52] Ems : The songs you sent me are genuinely so good
[04/08/2025, 09.42.13] Ems : Ayonha is poetry
[04/08/2025, 09.42.34] Ems : This just feels like I'm straight in the book
[04/08/2025, 09.43.44] Ems : If you want a really good driving song
[04/08/2025, 09.44.06] Ems : Real love baby by father John misty
[04/08/2025, 09.44.09] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[04/08/2025, 09.44.17] Ems : Play it
[04/08/2025, 09.44.25] Yousif Zaid: Just got back but yes
[04/08/2025, 09.44.32] Yousif Zaid: You translated the lyrics?
[04/08/2025, 09.44.40] Ems : Of course
[04/08/2025, 09.44.44] Ems : It's beautiful
[04/08/2025, 09.44.54] Yousif Zaid: You know more of the words than me then [04/08/2025, 09.45.06] Yousif Zaid: The Libyan dialect isn’t the easiest for me
[04/08/2025, 09.45.27] Ems : I think I can only really appreciate a dong if I know the lyrics
[04/08/2025, 09.46.15] Yousif Zaid: I translated coraline
[04/08/2025, 09.46.14] Ems : Also the music but if it has lyrics then I appreciate it much more if I know what it says
[04/08/2025, 09.46.30] Yousif Zaid: This is literally a slowed down “Sugar” by maroon 5
[04/08/2025, 09.46.59] Ems : Do you think? I feel like the vibe is way different
[04/08/2025, 09.47.59] Ems : What did you think
[04/08/2025, 09.48.04] Yousif Zaid: No i mean maroon 5 stole this melody note for note and turned it into a pop song
[04/08/2025, 09.49.05] Yousif Zaid: It’s obviously much better than “sugar” by maroon fucking 5
[04/08/2025, 09.49.30] Yousif Zaid: Lyrics don’t translate over so well but the song is beautiful
[04/08/2025, 09.49.42] Yousif Zaid: I imagine it’s the same with ayonha
[04/08/2025, 09.50.41] Ems : I read the translation and I nearly laughed
[04/08/2025, 09.51.26] Ems : Maroon 5 has a few decent songs but sugar is not one of them [04/08/2025, 09.52.13] Yousif Zaid: You are not wrong
[04/08/2025, 09.52.19] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[04/08/2025, 09.52.33] Yousif Zaid: Remember how we said let’s see them finish 10L milk? Well they did and they’re getting another 10
[04/08/2025, 09.54.50] Yousif Zaid: I just checked and it tracks, actually only thing being lost over translation is the rhyming
[04/08/2025, 09.55.02] Ems : These people have a problem
[04/08/2025, 09.55.07] Ems : Get them help
[04/08/2025, 09.55.22] Yousif Zaid: They’re researchers don’t worry their lifestyle is punishment enough
[04/08/2025, 09.55.40] Yousif Zaid: 10 years of school to make Italy wages
[04/08/2025, 09.55.50] Ems : Good cause 10L is not human
[04/08/2025, 09.55.59] Yousif Zaid: In like 3 working days
[04/08/2025, 09.57.18] Yousif Zaid: I wanna hear your thoughts on this one
[04/08/2025, 10.01.58] Ems : It's so good, the music is amazing
[04/08/2025, 10.02.14] Ems : The guitar really makes it
[04/08/2025, 10.03.00] Yousif Zaid: I love psychedelic rock
[04/08/2025, 10.03.41] Yousif Zaid: I’m trying to do my work as fast as physically possible so I can read in the reception until noon
[04/08/2025, 10.23.33] Ems : Nerd
[04/08/2025, 10.23.42] Yousif Zaid: :(
[04/08/2025, 10.23.48] Ems : No actually I'm like that as well
[04/08/2025, 10.24.11] Yousif Zaid: Just begged my boss to have DTU pay my parking ticket and she told me to kill myself
[04/08/2025, 10.24.13] Yousif Zaid: -900
[04/08/2025, 10.24.17] Yousif Zaid: That’s like 15 pints
[04/08/2025, 10.24.24] Ems : Once a little girl snitches on me for reading in class and the book was taken away from me
[04/08/2025, 10.24.28] Ems : That was middle school
[04/08/2025, 10.24.42] Ems : What fuck her
[04/08/2025, 10.25.02] Yousif Zaid: Want to scheme to ruin her life
[04/08/2025, 10.27.08] Ems : Oh her life is ruined she's a bitch
[04/08/2025, 10.27.15] Ems : She was a little loser
[04/08/2025, 10.27.16] Yousif Zaid: Do tell
[04/08/2025, 10.27.20] Yousif Zaid: Ahahhahahahahahah
[04/08/2025, 10.27.45] Ems : Nobody liked her I don't need to do anything
[04/08/2025, 10.27.51] Ems : She did it herself
[04/08/2025, 10.28.12] Yousif Zaid: What was her problem man
[04/08/2025, 10.28.51] Ems : I swear to god 12 years old snitching on me for reading during Italian grammar lessons
[04/08/2025, 10.29.16] Yousif Zaid: It’s like snitching in church cuz you’re saying your own prayer and not listening to the priest
[04/08/2025, 10.30.05] Ems : And the teacher took the book away, if I was the teacher I would've laughed
[04/08/2025, 10.30.17] Yousif Zaid: Did you ever get it back
[04/08/2025, 10.30.27] Yousif Zaid: Omg I’m imagining pulling a book out of 12 year old emma’s hands
[04/08/2025, 10.30.30] Yousif Zaid: Jesus Christ
[04/08/2025, 10.31.40] Ems : That was a whole thing as well, I asked the Spanish teacher who was teaching the next class, she gave it back but the Italian teacher got angry because she said it was her who should decide when to give it back
[04/08/2025, 10.32.13] Yousif Zaid: How can you have beef with a polite 12 year old girl
[04/08/2025, 10.32.22] Yousif Zaid: Whose crime was “reading”
[04/08/2025, 10.34.47] Ems : I don't know about polite but my parents found it quite funny
[04/08/2025, 10.34.52] Yousif Zaid: Like genuinely I had a 3rd grade teacher who would give me detention
[04/08/2025, 10.35.09] Yousif Zaid: But it was winter and there was nobody to watch me sit inside during recess
[04/08/2025, 10.35.24] Yousif Zaid: So she’d literally just force me to sit on the pavement outside in the cold and watch the other kids play
[04/08/2025, 10.36.37] Ems : What that's actually really mean
[04/08/2025, 10.37.01] Ems : And not what you would do to punish an 8 year old?
[04/08/2025, 10.37.10] Yousif Zaid: Fuck you Ms Denton
[04/08/2025, 10.37.16] Yousif Zaid: Glad your husband left you
[04/08/2025, 10.37.29] Ems : Teachers should have to pass a psychology before getting the job
[04/08/2025, 10.37.37] Ems : Yeah fuck ms denton
[04/08/2025, 10.37.42] Yousif Zaid: Twice divorced no prospects hag
[04/08/2025, 10.40.09] Yousif Zaid: In fairness I was an annoying child
[04/08/2025, 11.40.33] Ems : Don't defend ms denton she doesn't deserve it
[04/08/2025, 12.37.28] Yousif Zaid: Alright well the book is done
[04/08/2025, 12.39.05] Yousif Zaid: The chronological order of things is a bit hazy to me
[04/08/2025, 12.39.36] Yousif Zaid: I did find myself thinking “man Theo is acting weird as hell following these people around and looking into this ladies house”
[04/08/2025, 12.39.59] Yousif Zaid: And I did notice that the whole “double infidelity” thing was repeating itself
[04/08/2025, 12.50.37] Yousif Zaid: The twist was pretty good, and the book was nice
[04/08/2025, 12.50.48] Yousif Zaid: I’m not *crazy* about it though
[04/08/2025, 13.01.37] Ems : Now you see why I couldn't answer anything
[04/08/2025, 13.01.55] Ems : But it's fair enough you don't like it
[04/08/2025, 13.02.12] Ems : I thought it was quite cool I read it in a day at the time
[04/08/2025, 13.02.26] Ems : What did you not like?
[04/08/2025, 13.17.20] Yousif Zaid: It’s not that I didn’t like it, I also think it’s a very cool book and it was worth reading and buying
[04/08/2025, 13.17.29] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna have to be a bit snobby here but
[04/08/2025, 13.28.26] Yousif Zaid: I like when there’s an interesting plot AND it gives you something to think about
[04/08/2025, 13.29.08] Yousif Zaid: Like the brothers karamazov had a cool plot twist with regards to the fathers murder but it also made me have a think about some stuff
[04/08/2025, 13.29.38] Yousif Zaid: I’ve read this now and I think it’s very entertaining and all that but that’s sort of it. I have no reason to think about the book more
[04/08/2025, 13.30.32] Yousif Zaid: For whom the bell tolls? Cool story about a military operation to blow up a bridge. Also made me wonder if I was really doing all I could to make life nicer for others, that kind of stuff
[04/08/2025, 15.04.31] Yousif Zaid: Oh I just reread this I come off very snobby that’s not good
[04/08/2025, 15.23.57] Ems : No I agree with what you said, I do think sometimes books can just be entertaining though
[04/08/2025, 15.24.15] Yousif Zaid: And this is one of those
[04/08/2025, 15.24.28] Yousif Zaid: And I agree
[04/08/2025, 15.24.44] Ems : But yeah it's just that the silent patient is a cool book in my opinion
[04/08/2025, 15.24.59] Yousif Zaid: It is
[04/08/2025, 15.25.10] Ems : It isn't master class literature but not everything has to be If that makes sense
[04/08/2025, 15.25.25] Ems : I do still think you should read the lord of the flies
[04/08/2025, 15.25.41] Yousif Zaid: I think I’ve bought enough books for now
[04/08/2025, 15.26.58] Ems : I'm not saying right now, also books can be read in a longer period of time
[04/08/2025, 15.27.13] Yousif Zaid: I text back when I’m back
[04/08/2025, 15.27.16] Yousif Zaid: Driving rn
[04/08/2025, 15.35.18] Yousif Zaid: I am a bit confused about the actual chronology of the book
[04/08/2025, 15.35.37] Yousif Zaid: So this guy meets Kathy, they both cheat on their partners and get together
[04/08/2025, 15.36.16] Yousif Zaid: Then Kathy starts cheating and he does the Greek tragedy alecestis thing on what ends up being Alicia and Gabriel
[04/08/2025, 15.36.37] Yousif Zaid: 6 years later he feels bad and tries psychotherapizing her back to health?
[04/08/2025, 15.50.47] Yousif Zaid: It was a very good twist that it turned out that the whole “personal life” / “work in the hospital” were actually 6 years apart without us knowing
[04/08/2025, 16.43.45] Ems : I think it was more to shut her up
[04/08/2025, 16.43.53] Ems : To not incriminate himself
[04/08/2025, 16.44.02] Ems : Exactly
[04/08/2025, 16.44.13] Ems : I just had the best nap of my life I swear
[04/08/2025, 16.45.24] Yousif Zaid: Wrinkles in the skin from the sheets?
[04/08/2025, 16.46.07] Yousif Zaid: I wish there were more hours in the day. I want to play guitar, go gym, read and do nerd shit
[04/08/2025, 16.52.12] Ems : No but i fell asleep with tea and a book in my hands and I partly spilled the tea on myself
[04/08/2025, 16.52.37] Yousif Zaid: That’s adorable
[04/08/2025, 16.58.29] Yousif Zaid: I spoke with my Greek coworker about the letter today. She suggested calling the post-office and asking them if they’ve sent it
[04/08/2025, 16.58.57] Yousif Zaid: I asked her if she thinks it’ll arrive and she giggled and said “it could”. So she doesn’t believe in her own people very much
[04/08/2025, 16.59.08] Yousif Zaid: I don’t think you should bother. We keep waiting in my opinion
[04/08/2025, 17.03.55] Ems : It'll arrive.
[04/08/2025, 17.04.01] Ems : I have faith
[04/08/2025, 17.04.11] Ems : (the Greeks are useless)
[04/08/2025, 17.04.12] Yousif Zaid: I have faith in Nikos Christodoupulis
[04/08/2025, 17.04.24] Yousif Zaid: (Utterly fucking useless human beings)
[04/08/2025, 17.04.35] Ems : (why do they even bother)
[04/08/2025, 17.04.50] Yousif Zaid: (I’m gonna go cuss out my Greek friend Jim)
[04/08/2025, 17.06.01] Ems : Tell Jim that if the letter doesn't arrive it's personal
[04/08/2025, 17.06.17] Yousif Zaid: Didn’t I tell you to beat him senseless
[04/08/2025, 18.16.14] Ems : You did, now I'm sorry I didn't listen
[05/08/2025, 00.52.56] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[05/08/2025, 00.53.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[05/08/2025, 08.50.33] Ems : I read about it and it says its name is Chuckie, this is very cute
[05/08/2025, 08.50.48] Ems : I kind of relate to the mouse
[05/08/2025, 08.51.03] Yousif Zaid: How so?
[05/08/2025, 08.51.58] Ems : Stupid reasons, just his face and my love for berries
[05/08/2025, 08.52.20] Yousif Zaid: So it’s just one mouse in all his drawings?
[05/08/2025, 08.53.11] Ems : Yes I think so
[05/08/2025, 08.53.39] Ems : image omitted
[05/08/2025, 08.53.45] Ems : How cute
[05/08/2025, 08.54.49] Yousif Zaid: I love the one with the lipstick
[05/08/2025, 09.06.47] Ems : image omitted
[05/08/2025, 09.07.05] Yousif Zaid: That’s literally you
[05/08/2025, 09.08.18] Ems : Hahahahahahah
[05/08/2025, 09.08.26] Ems : The one with the ring is nice as well
[05/08/2025, 09.14.09] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[05/08/2025, 10.38.59] Ems : How did you find out about this?
[05/08/2025, 10.39.40] Yousif Zaid: Browsing twitter
[05/08/2025, 10.40.17] Yousif Zaid: The weather is finally nice over here, we had flooding during the weekend and yesterday
[05/08/2025, 10.52.50] Ems : There was a whole hurricane on a beach here
[05/08/2025, 10.53.09] Ems : I forget, are you taking the science and tech course?
[05/08/2025, 10.53.28] Yousif Zaid: No ma’am, going to Italy this August, remember?
[05/08/2025, 10.53.54] Ems : [05/08/2025, 10.54.04] Ems : Yeah I just meant you're going on the 18th
[05/08/2025, 10.54.24] Ems : So maybe you decided to do it before
[05/08/2025, 10.54.36] Ems : I do remember something about you going to italy
[05/08/2025, 10.55.06] Yousif Zaid: To see some girl with a stretchy face in Rome
[05/08/2025, 10.56.16] Ems : I don't think I'll ever take snus in front of you again
[05/08/2025, 10.56.41] Yousif Zaid: At the very least you’ll turn around
[05/08/2025, 10.56.49] Yousif Zaid: It’s a good thing I think? Collagen and keratin and stuff
[05/08/2025, 10.59.18] Ems : I'm glad my skin is healthy, I will still always turn around
[05/08/2025, 10.59.40] Ems : I now realised they also have snus here but as far as I can tell it's only mint
[05/08/2025, 11.01.52] Yousif Zaid: Maybe it’s a law in Italy like in Denmark
[05/08/2025, 11.02.32] Yousif Zaid: I have to go and buy a 500 dkk textbook
[05/08/2025, 11.02.45] Yousif Zaid: “Feedback Control Systems”
[05/08/2025, 11.02.48] Yousif Zaid: A real page turner
[05/08/2025, 11.03.28] Ems : Seems interesting
[05/08/2025, 11.03.38] Yousif Zaid: Uh huh
[05/08/2025, 11.03.48] Ems : Can't wait to know why apple flavour isn't allowed
[05/08/2025, 11.03.59] Yousif Zaid: I gave my Danish coworker one of these Native American cigs
[05/08/2025, 11.04.16] Yousif Zaid: Danes are apparently very racist to people from Greenland and he said “what do you call a Greenlander?”
[05/08/2025, 11.04.24] Yousif Zaid: “A freezer Indian”
[05/08/2025, 11.04.37] Yousif Zaid: Not very proud to say I chuckled
[05/08/2025, 11.12.54] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[05/08/2025, 11.19.39] Ems : Of course you did
[05/08/2025, 11.19.45] Ems : It is kind of funny
[05/08/2025, 11.19.56] Ems : The belt is awesome
[05/08/2025, 11.20.05] Ems : Also you have the cigs
[05/08/2025, 11.20.12] Ems : You just need some whiskey
[05/08/2025, 11.20.16] Yousif Zaid: I’m dressing out my mind for these old farts in the office
[05/08/2025, 11.20.30] Ems : They don't deserve it
[05/08/2025, 11.20.35] Ems : They wouldn't get it
[05/08/2025, 11.20.42] Yousif Zaid: There’s nobody worth impressing here
[05/08/2025, 11.20.53] Ems : But you can act superior this way
[05/08/2025, 11.22.37] Yousif Zaid: There’s a 30 something year old PhD student named Gloria moscatelli here who touches my arm from time to time actually
[05/08/2025, 11.23.12] Yousif Zaid: I can pretend I’m dressing up for her
[05/08/2025, 11.38.44] Ems : That is the most Italian name I've ever heard
[05/08/2025, 11.39.00] Yousif Zaid: She says ciao
[05/08/2025, 11.39.13] Yousif Zaid: Not to you right now I just mean generally
[05/08/2025, 11.39.27] Ems : Good idea, this way you always have a reason to wear belts and cowboy boots
[05/08/2025, 11.39.30] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[05/08/2025, 11.39.33] Ems : No I got that
[05/08/2025, 11.40.32] Yousif Zaid: Once she caught me drinking coffee out of a champagne glass because I couldn’t find mugs and she called me a “silly boy”
[05/08/2025, 11.40.48] Yousif Zaid: She immediately opened the drawer to the mugs that I ignored and I felt dumb
[05/08/2025, 11.46.09] Ems : "silly boy" is such a funny thing to say though
[05/08/2025, 11.46.14] Ems : I'll start using that
[05/08/2025, 11.46.28] Ems : Going around saying it to people who do dumb things
[05/08/2025, 11.48.02] Yousif Zaid: Really gave me the impression that she sees me as an actual child
[05/08/2025, 11.48.11] Yousif Zaid: So this is maybe pointless
[05/08/2025, 13.08.07] Yousif Zaid: I’m only 13 pages into heart of darkness and at this rate it might end up being my favourite short story ever
[05/08/2025, 14.15.28] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[05/08/2025, 14.17.04] Ems : Let me know what you think, if you like it I'll read it
[05/08/2025, 14.17.18] Ems : Very stylish especially with the boots
[05/08/2025, 14.20.16] Yousif Zaid: It’s like 3 short stories with the same protagonist, the first one is called Youth and it’s like
[05/08/2025, 14.21.09] Yousif Zaid: About being young and ambitious, doing difficult things and being happy with the struggle. In Marlowes context he does dangerous sea voyages but in a way us going to uni and studying hard resonates with it
[05/08/2025, 14.21.35] Yousif Zaid: His boat is named “Judea” and its motto is “Do or Die”
[05/08/2025, 15.57.27] Ems : Ok I'll admit it sounds very good
[05/08/2025, 15.57.27] Ems : I'll try it
[05/08/2025, 16.04.15] Yousif Zaid: I’ll lend it to you
[05/08/2025, 16.28.55] Ems : Thanks
[05/08/2025, 16.29.13] Ems : Right now I'm studying biology to be prepared for September [05/08/2025, 16.29.39] Ems : My high school teacher was absolute shit
[05/08/2025, 16.31.49] Yousif Zaid: You’re studying biology? Like with a textbook?
[05/08/2025, 16.32.18] Yousif Zaid: I should brush up on math for a week before I go to Italy I think
[05/08/2025, 16.32.24] Yousif Zaid: Just do a past paper and refresh the shit
[05/08/2025, 16.35.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m also completely fucking cooked for bioengineering
[05/08/2025, 16.52.27] Ems : No I'm gathering information online
[05/08/2025, 16.52.47] Ems : For that I'll let you tell me how bad it is
[05/08/2025, 16.52.57] Ems : And let you give me your notes
[05/08/2025, 16.53.15] Ems : How bad do you think advanced engineering maths is going to be?
[05/08/2025, 17.11.21] Yousif Zaid: God help you
[05/08/2025, 17.11.26] Yousif Zaid: Easy for us I’m sure
[05/08/2025, 17.12.49] Yousif Zaid: How do you even study biology? There’s no math to do is there
[05/08/2025, 17.12.59] Yousif Zaid: You just stare at a diagram of a testicle or what?
[05/08/2025, 17.20.03] Ems : No I'm gathering information
[05/08/2025, 17.20.09] Ems : Exactly, you get it
[05/08/2025, 17.20.18] Ems : That's what I've been doing for an hour
[05/08/2025, 17.23.25] Yousif Zaid: This is ominous
[05/08/2025, 17.23.33] Yousif Zaid: Did you learn anything new?
[05/08/2025, 17.33.59] Ems : Yes I did unfortunately it's not very advanced stuff so I'll have to study much more this month
[05/08/2025, 18.18.22] Yousif Zaid: My brother brought me a chicken sandwich from the states and I ate it after a 16 hour journey
[05/08/2025, 18.18.36] Yousif Zaid: In your professional opinion what will happen to my body
[05/08/2025, 20.49.31] Ems : My professional opinion is that maybe the fermented food will be good for your gut
[05/08/2025, 20.49.39] Ems : I'm a glass half full kind of biologist
[05/08/2025, 20.50.09] Yousif Zaid: 1. One of the funnier things I’ve heard someone say to me
[05/08/2025, 20.50.12] Yousif Zaid: 2. I’m in pain
[05/08/2025, 20.51.20] Ems : Oh no ouch
[05/08/2025, 20.51.31] Ems : The chicken must have really done the job
[05/08/2025, 20.51.33] Yousif Zaid: My tummy hurts ems
[05/08/2025, 20.51.33] Ems : Hahahahahahahah
[05/08/2025, 20.51.39] Ems : This is quite funny
[05/08/2025, 20.51.59] Yousif Zaid: God this is the most Yousif way to die I swear to you
[05/08/2025, 20.52.10] Yousif Zaid: I’m such a stupid retard
[05/08/2025, 20.52.12] Yousif Zaid: A silly boy
[05/08/2025, 20.52.13] Ems : If it makes you feel better I one had 5 days expired mushrooms in Denmark and it was the most painful thing ever
[05/08/2025, 20.52.21] Ems : And I had expired chicken with them
[05/08/2025, 20.52.26] Ems : They were the side
[05/08/2025, 20.52.40] Yousif Zaid: You had dinner at the chum bucket what the fuck
[05/08/2025, 20.52.57] Ems : I would've eaten the sandwich as well to be honest
[05/08/2025, 20.53.20] Yousif Zaid: I’m not a smart man Jenny
[05/08/2025, 20.53.21] Ems : Expiry dates are an approximation in my expert opinion
[05/08/2025, 20.53.34] Yousif Zaid: God were never gonna make it are we
[05/08/2025, 20.53.57] Ems : No I will forever eat the expired mushrooms
[05/08/2025, 20.54.09] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t even know mushrooms could expire
[05/08/2025, 20.54.22] Yousif Zaid: They look expired when you buy them from the store
[05/08/2025, 20.55.19] Ems : I will say they did look expired but I was tired and my thought process was "what's the worst that can happen"
[05/08/2025, 20.55.28] Yousif Zaid: Who the fuck puts cheese on a chicken sandwich
[05/08/2025, 20.55.44] Yousif Zaid: And who eats it after 16 hours of it being in an airplane
[05/08/2025, 20.55.58] Yousif Zaid: I might actually have to call off work tommorow
[05/08/2025, 20.56.16] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHHA
[05/08/2025, 20.56.21] Ems : This is getting funnier
[05/08/2025, 20.56.35] Yousif Zaid: Emma I stepped outside and got fresh air and it was like
[05/08/2025, 20.56.43] Yousif Zaid: How they sent hysterical women out to the sea
[05/08/2025, 20.56.46] Yousif Zaid: Back in the day
[05/08/2025, 20.57.00] Yousif Zaid: “The fresh air will be good for the patients sensibilities”
[05/08/2025, 20.57.48] Ems : You'll have to do the Victorian bed bound act for the day
[05/08/2025, 20.58.01] Yousif Zaid: I already kind of did
[05/08/2025, 20.58.04] Yousif Zaid: I do it every time I’m sick
[05/08/2025, 20.58.04] Ems : And have some herbal tea or something
[05/08/2025, 20.58.25] Yousif Zaid: I was lazily laying in bed on top of a bunch of laundry I was supposed to fold and put away
[05/08/2025, 20.58.29] Yousif Zaid: I call my mom in the room
[05/08/2025, 20.58.46] Yousif Zaid: I pathetically mutter “mom can you throw these clothes under my legs onto the floor”
[05/08/2025, 20.58.52] Yousif Zaid: “My legs don’t work”
[05/08/2025, 20.59.18] Yousif Zaid: She throws them on the floor and turns on my desk fan and pulls my curtains and I nap for an hour and I wake up feeling like I got hit by a car
[05/08/2025, 21.04.43] Ems : Was there poison in that sandwich or something
[05/08/2025, 21.04.50] Ems : At this point there must be
[05/08/2025, 21.08.40] Yousif Zaid: Unrefridgerated poultry for 17 hours IS poison I think
[05/08/2025, 21.11.41] Yousif Zaid: I just did the
[05/08/2025, 21.12.08] Yousif Zaid: “Meow” sound affect at my dad when he sounded irritated at something and I feared for my life
[05/08/2025, 21.27.21] Ems : I knew that would bite you in the ass one day
[05/08/2025, 21.27.38] Ems : What was the response?
[05/08/2025, 21.31.22] Yousif Zaid: A stare, then he said “grown ass man with hair on his face meowing” under his breath in Arabic
[05/08/2025, 22.22.07] Ems : This is the only right answer
[05/08/2025, 22.24.42] Yousif Zaid: don't check instagram
[05/08/2025, 22.47.48] Yousif Zaid: my brother just suprised me he comes back from america and tells me he wants to be a diplomat
[05/08/2025, 22.47.52] Yousif Zaid: study international relations
[05/08/2025, 22.50.39] Ems : Wow
[05/08/2025, 22.50.47] Ems : I'm happy he found his way
[05/08/2025, 22.50.55] Yousif Zaid: which is funny to me because he's like
[05/08/2025, 22.50.58] Yousif Zaid: racist? hahahahaha
[05/08/2025, 22.51.28] Ems : Most diplomats are

[05/08/2025, 22.51.41] Yousif Zaid: i believe in him
[05/08/2025, 22.51.45] Yousif Zaid: marta is still a philosopher?
[05/08/2025, 22.52.08] Ems : She's thinking of studying something else
[05/08/2025, 22.52.14] Ems : More scientific oriented
[05/08/2025, 22.52.20] Ems : Hasn't fully decided yet
[05/08/2025, 22.52.43] Yousif Zaid: i don't know her very well but i could see her doing philosophy
[05/08/2025, 22.52.55] Ems : I suppose by the time you'll be here you can interrogate her and she might have answers
[05/08/2025, 22.53.10] Yousif Zaid: what's it called? classical liberal arts? i think it's very cool as an education
[05/08/2025, 22.53.26] Ems : She's considering that as well
[05/08/2025, 22.53.34] Ems : I'm trying to help as much as possible
[05/08/2025, 22.53.48] Ems : We're going to the Netherlands to see unis as well
[05/08/2025, 22.53.54] Yousif Zaid: oh wow
[05/08/2025, 22.54.00] Yousif Zaid: i went to visit an art school in malmo once
[05/08/2025, 22.54.11] Yousif Zaid: and literally all the students at the open house just "looked like that"
[05/08/2025, 22.54.14] Yousif Zaid: like you know what i mean
[05/08/2025, 22.54.34] Ems : Yeah yeah I know exactly
[05/08/2025, 22.54.48] Ems : I think it's bedtime for me

[06/08/2025, 10.59.44] Ems : More milk?
[06/08/2025, 11.00.20] Ems : It's so fun that they let you drive this though
[06/08/2025, 11.00.41] Ems : Hahahahahhaha the "no" wasn't aggressive it was surpised
[06/08/2025, 11.06.23] Yousif Zaid: Yes ma’am, 10 more liters. I hate the researchers in this building
[06/08/2025, 11.06.32] Yousif Zaid: I kinda just grabbed the keys I can’t lie to you
[06/08/2025, 11.07.03] Yousif Zaid: Got scared there for a second
[06/08/2025, 11.07.07] Yousif Zaid: Would have flinched in real life
[06/08/2025, 11.57.52] Ems : Yeah I reread and it did come off cary
[06/08/2025, 11.57.56] Ems : Scary*
[06/08/2025, 11.58.23] Ems : At this point they drink more than actual babies
[06/08/2025, 13.47.24] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/08/2025, 13.47.29] Yousif Zaid: This shit is so good what
[06/08/2025, 15.14.03] Ems : I've played this multiple times in your car I think
[06/08/2025, 15.14.15] Ems : It's been one of my most played for years
[06/08/2025, 15.14.19] Ems : She's so great
[06/08/2025, 15.14.29] Yousif Zaid: It’s real catchy
[06/08/2025, 15.14.52] Yousif Zaid: Also that “be my baby” song by the ronettes that one is lovely also
[06/08/2025, 15.15.26] Ems : It really is
[06/08/2025, 15.15.34] Ems : Are these in our playlist?
[06/08/2025, 15.15.40] Yousif Zaid: Yep
[06/08/2025, 15.15.56] Ems : It's top tier
[06/08/2025, 15.16.10] Yousif Zaid: It decided to throw another carti song in there
[06/08/2025, 15.16.22] Yousif Zaid: It’s like a landmine next to the rest of the indie stuff
[06/08/2025, 15.16.52] Ems : Wait you can change the playlist I didn't know
[06/08/2025, 15.17.01] Yousif Zaid: It changes daily
[06/08/2025, 15.17.06] Yousif Zaid: Automatically
[06/08/2025, 15.17.14] Ems : Oh yeah I know
[06/08/2025, 15.17.28] Yousif Zaid: I’m not choosing to include “Fuck on my DJ” next to the Amy wine house
[06/08/2025, 15.17.44] Ems : You would do that
[06/08/2025, 15.17.47] Ems : Easily
[06/08/2025, 15.17.57] Yousif Zaid: I keep my stuff separate
[06/08/2025, 15.18.22] Ems : Is this the song you liked the most from mine?
[06/08/2025, 15.18.35] Yousif Zaid: It’s today’s favourite I think
[06/08/2025, 15.18.42] Yousif Zaid: Out of the ones with just your profile pic next to it
[06/08/2025, 15.19.46] Ems : It doesn't show on my phone in our playlist that's weird
[06/08/2025, 15.19.59] Yousif Zaid: Go figure
[06/08/2025, 15.20.01] Yousif Zaid: What are you up to
[06/08/2025, 15.20.36] Ems : I went to the dentist this morning and I'm going to pack my stuff for tomorrow now
[06/08/2025, 15.20.47] Ems : Heading to ponza
[06/08/2025, 15.20.50] Ems : You?
[06/08/2025, 15.21.15] Yousif Zaid: Getting ready to go shopping with the boys? Very atypical behavior from them
[06/08/2025, 15.22.49] Yousif Zaid: Did you bite the dentists fingers
[06/08/2025, 15.39.27] Ems : Oh that's fun
[06/08/2025, 15.39.35] Ems : Shoppin with the guys
[06/08/2025, 15.39.46] Ems : Funny thing is I did at one point

[06/08/2025, 15.40.50] Yousif Zaid: I reply later
[06/08/2025, 15.51.07] Yousif Zaid: I always try to bite at least once when I’m at the dentist
[06/08/2025, 15.51.44] Yousif Zaid: Did you say you were going with your sister?
[06/08/2025, 16.22.13] Ems : Don't get killed
[06/08/2025, 16.22.20] Ems : Friend
[06/08/2025, 18.24.36] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/08/2025, 18.24.36] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/08/2025, 18.38.02] Ems : They are really lovely
[06/08/2025, 18.38.09] Ems : I would buy them
[06/08/2025, 18.38.14] Ems : Is it my size?
[06/08/2025, 18.47.54] Yousif Zaid: I’m not 100% sure but they’re only 100 dkk
[06/08/2025, 18.48.14] Yousif Zaid: With an eyeball measurement I would say they’re probably close enough to your size
[06/08/2025, 19.17.04] Ems : That's really good
[06/08/2025, 19.17.24] Ems : I keep hating glanton more and more
[06/08/2025, 19.17.33] Ems : What's his deal with the ferry
[06/08/2025, 19.36.19] Ems : Oh he's been murdered never mind
[06/08/2025, 20.32.26] Yousif Zaid: He’s awful
[06/08/2025, 20.32.42] Yousif Zaid: I think they’re just greedy I don’t remember their exact motivation
[06/08/2025, 20.32.48] Yousif Zaid: Crazy last words no?
[06/08/2025, 20.32.58] Yousif Zaid: Sorry I wasn’t replying
[06/08/2025, 20.33.31] Yousif Zaid: Had an absolutely tragic shopping experience with the boys. We had a guy try on 150 pairs of jeans knowing he needed jeans and he didn’t buy a single one despite liking several
[06/08/2025, 20.33.48] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/08/2025, 20.57.22] Ems : Badass
[06/08/2025, 20.57.42] Ems : That drains all the energy out
[06/08/2025, 20.57.49] Ems : Looks amazing
[06/08/2025, 20.57.55] Yousif Zaid: I was getting upset at the end
[06/08/2025, 20.58.05] Yousif Zaid: Everything is too baggy or too skinny
[06/08/2025, 20.58.19] Yousif Zaid: He has my waist size but like 20 cm shorter than me
[06/08/2025, 20.58.19] Ems : Head starts spinning and lights seem too bright
[06/08/2025, 20.58.39] Yousif Zaid: I was beginning to reply in Arabic on instinct
[06/08/2025, 20.59.08] Ems : That's when It get bad
[06/08/2025, 20.59.13] Ems : I just stop replying
[06/08/2025, 20.59.31] Yousif Zaid: Louis bought a pair of pants because he thought the girl in the store was cute
[06/08/2025, 20.59.45] Yousif Zaid: Pink linen pants
[06/08/2025, 20.59.52] Ems : Hahahahhahahahah
[06/08/2025, 20.59.57] Ems : Good move
[06/08/2025, 21.00.06] Yousif Zaid: He bought a pair of pink linen pants to impress the store girl
[06/08/2025, 21.00.20] Yousif Zaid: I keep rereading it man and it doesn’t make any more sense than before
[06/08/2025, 21.00.27] Ems : How did that go
[06/08/2025, 21.00.33] Ems : I bet well
[06/08/2025, 21.00.52] Yousif Zaid: She said “have a good day” and he replied “god arbejdslyst” and walked off
[06/08/2025, 21.00.59] Yousif Zaid: Not exactly the art of seduction
[06/08/2025, 21.01.32] Ems : Must have impressed the shit out of her
[06/08/2025, 21.02.44] Yousif Zaid: I don’t want to spoil anything but I’m 99% sure this won’t be a spoiler
[06/08/2025, 21.02.56] Yousif Zaid: Did you get to the part where the kid got separated from the group and lost?
[06/08/2025, 21.03.15] Ems : I did
[06/08/2025, 21.03.24] Ems : I was about to block you
[06/08/2025, 21.03.45] Yousif Zaid: What did you think of the burning tree in the freezing cold desert
[06/08/2025, 21.06.09] Ems : I thought he was alluccinating to be honest but I don't think that's it
[06/08/2025, 21.06.24] Ems : It's probably a symbol for hope somehow
[06/08/2025, 21.07.27] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t analyse it myself I just think about it and picture it often
[06/08/2025, 21.08.41] Yousif Zaid: I really thought he was going to die, but the different animals from the desert congregating around it is so cool
[06/08/2025, 21.09.50] Yousif Zaid: Almost like an act of mercy from god or whatever
[06/08/2025, 21.10.50] Ems : I think what struck me the most today was the woman taking care of the idiot
[06/08/2025, 21.11.12] Ems : Between all the scalping there's one genuinely good act
[06/08/2025, 21.11.19] Yousif Zaid: I completely forgot about that and I teared up a bit when I read that for the first time [06/08/2025, 21.12.06] Yousif Zaid: I’m somehow very sensitive about disabled people
[06/08/2025, 21.30.49] Yousif Zaid: It’s like the opposite of the judges world view no? He says existence is war and god is war or whatever but all the animals chill next to their predators and stuff
[06/08/2025, 21.49.26] Ems : It's a beautiful scene
[06/08/2025, 21.49.37] Ems : Yeah I didn't think about that you're right
[06/08/2025, 21.49.57] Ems : I hadn't focused on the burning tree that much but it is very interesting
[06/08/2025, 21.50.08] Ems : Also I loved the judge's speech
[06/08/2025, 21.50.12] Yousif Zaid: It’s the part I remember from the book the most for some reason
[06/08/2025, 21.50.16] Yousif Zaid: Around the campfire?
[06/08/2025, 21.50.38] Ems : There's a lot of them but yes
[06/08/2025, 21.50.51] Yousif Zaid: Something about how
[06/08/2025, 21.50.52] Yousif Zaid: Uhhh
[06/08/2025, 21.51.02] Yousif Zaid: If something exists without his knowledge it exists without his consent
[06/08/2025, 21.51.54] Ems : Yes that one I loved
Also the most recent one about how war is an intrinsic quality in humans, even though I don't think I agree
[06/08/2025, 21.52.26] Yousif Zaid: I hadn’t actually given that any thought
[06/08/2025, 21.52.29] Yousif Zaid: Why don’t you agree?
[06/08/2025, 21.53.48] Ems : I agree for the book's purpose, all the characters seem like that except the woman I was talking about
But even then they all seem to come off as worse people after the slightest hint of violence
[06/08/2025, 21.54.09] Ems : So i think that means it's not innate in humans
[06/08/2025, 21.54.41] Yousif Zaid: So their moral degradation is proof that humans aren’t pre-built for violence? [06/08/2025, 21.55.21] Ems : Like where I am right now in the book violence is meaningless, they do it just because, it doesn't have an objective anymore
[06/08/2025, 21.55.23] Ems : Yes
[06/08/2025, 21.55.41] Ems : Like brown setting the soldier on fire
[06/08/2025, 21.55.53] Yousif Zaid: I forget these small details
[06/08/2025, 21.56.05] Yousif Zaid: That’s actually really convincing
[06/08/2025, 21.56.16] Ems : Of course it's normal it's because I just read it
[06/08/2025, 21.56.36] Yousif Zaid: I was thinking just now and was like “I can’t think of a single time period where there wasn’t war”
[06/08/2025, 21.56.57] Yousif Zaid: But you’re making sense, in every documented case of it, it kinda reduces us to animals doesn’t it
[06/08/2025, 21.57.24] Yousif Zaid: Smashing infants into rocks goes against every human instinct possible
[06/08/2025, 21.57.32] Ems : Yes I know that's what I was thinking as well
[06/08/2025, 21.58.42] Ems : My point is, humans differentiate themselves from animals because of their morals and mind, and violence takes that away, so that means that it reduces people to something that doesn't characterize them
[06/08/2025, 21.59.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m not trying to flatter you or anything but I feel like I’m speaking to my old English teacher
[06/08/2025, 22.00.29] Yousif Zaid: I’m glad you’re reading it, you have the most interesting things to say out of all the people I know who have read it
[06/08/2025, 22.00.39] Ems : I reread the text and I sound like MY English teacher help
[06/08/2025, 22.00.58] Ems : I'm really glad you think so I'm enjoying it very much
[06/08/2025, 22.01.19] Yousif Zaid: Book club!
[06/08/2025, 22.01.25] Yousif Zaid: 2 person book club
[06/08/2025, 22.02.13] Ems : We should do a dtu book club, it would be so funny to see engineers talking about literature
[06/08/2025, 22.02.41] Yousif Zaid: I immediately corrected myself to this specifically so I wouldn’t have to hear some dipshit suggest we read “48 laws of power”
[06/08/2025, 22.02.51] Yousif Zaid: Or “atomic habits”
[06/08/2025, 22.03.23] Yousif Zaid: Or anything by Jordan Peterson
[06/08/2025, 22.03.23] Ems : What you don't want to hear Aidan's opinions on pride and prejudice?
[06/08/2025, 22.03.44] Yousif Zaid: I really really do not
[06/08/2025, 22.03.46] Ems : Or god forbid vendat
[06/08/2025, 22.03.59] Yousif Zaid: “Guys can we read American psycho”
[06/08/2025, 22.04.13] Yousif Zaid: I immediately imagined him being like “can we read the life of pi”
[06/08/2025, 22.04.32] Ems : Life of pi is great what are you talking about
[06/08/2025, 22.04.42] Yousif Zaid: It’s got an Indian in it doesn’t it
[06/08/2025, 22.05.18] Ems : For fucks sake I don't want to hear anything he has to say about it
[06/08/2025, 22.05.21] Yousif Zaid: Terrible joke I should be publicly shamed
[06/08/2025, 22.05.29] Ems : I would be so disgusted
[06/08/2025, 22.05.35] Ems : It does
[06/08/2025, 22.05.37] Ems : Indeed
[06/08/2025, 22.05.47] Yousif Zaid: There’s just some books that are like
[06/08/2025, 22.06.07] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know. The books themselves are not bad but usually the people who like them happen to be really uninteresting or stupid
[06/08/2025, 22.06.41] Ems : Actually if I imagine him proposing a book about an Indian boy stuck on a raft it's really funny
[06/08/2025, 22.06.51] Ems : Very true
[06/08/2025, 22.06.57] Yousif Zaid: Do you know how many times I’ve heard a podcast bro I know say something like “you should read the prince by Machiavelli”
[06/08/2025, 22.07.05] Yousif Zaid: “Duuude the art of war sun tzu”
[06/08/2025, 22.07.22] Yousif Zaid: “Omg meditations by Marcus Aurelius so stoic and cool”
[06/08/2025, 22.07.36] Yousif Zaid: It’s enough to make me sick
[06/08/2025, 22.07.56] Ems : It's like a girl proposing to read it ends with us
[06/08/2025, 22.07.59] Ems : Or after
[06/08/2025, 22.08.08] Ems : Same thing
[06/08/2025, 22.08.16] Yousif Zaid: I hate Colleen hoover so much it makes me seem psychotic
[06/08/2025, 22.08.43] Yousif Zaid: Like I usually try to let people enjoy what they like but I have an irrational hatred for it
[06/08/2025, 22.08.52] Ems : The storylines are terrible but the dialogue makes me sick
[06/08/2025, 22.09.00] Ems : I can't handle it
[06/08/2025, 22.09.03] Yousif Zaid: “We both laugh at our sons big balls”
[06/08/2025, 22.09.09] Yousif Zaid: Hey lady why don’t you kill yourself
[06/08/2025, 22.09.16] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
[06/08/2025, 22.09.36] Yousif Zaid: Like I could win a “should you kill yourself” debate against Colleen hoover
[06/08/2025, 22.09.56] Yousif Zaid: I could logically present arguments to her
[06/08/2025, 22.10.41] Ems : Try it please I can't hear about another book recommendation from her
[06/08/2025, 22.10.50] Yousif Zaid: Girl I went to high school with bought it, read 50 pages, threw it in the garbage infront of ppl, it was fished out of the garbage by another girl, and the same thing repeated like 6 times [06/08/2025, 22.11.12] Yousif Zaid: It went around the entire classroom
[06/08/2025, 22.11.21] Ems : They are cursed
[06/08/2025, 22.11.43] Yousif Zaid: Self help books immediately make me think a person is stupid
[06/08/2025, 22.12.58] Ems : Yeah so true
[06/08/2025, 22.13.07] Ems : Some books shouldn't be read
[06/08/2025, 22.13.10] Ems : I stand by that
[06/08/2025, 22.13.11] Yousif Zaid: Like I can literally
[06/08/2025, 22.13.14] Yousif Zaid: Omg hold on
[06/08/2025, 22.13.39] Yousif Zaid: Okay I want you to picture this

[06/08/2025, 22.14.04] Ems : "omg"
[06/08/2025, 22.14.07] Ems : Ew
[06/08/2025, 22.14.20] Ems : Ehg
[06/08/2025, 22.14.29] Ems : I could see him do that unfortunately
[06/08/2025, 22.14.37] Yousif Zaid: This is making me crease
[06/08/2025, 22.14.47] Yousif Zaid: ??? Fuck you?
[06/08/2025, 22.14.56] Ems : "omg"
[06/08/2025, 22.14.59] Ems : Hahahahahahahaha
[06/08/2025, 22.15.12] Yousif Zaid: I can’t say oh my god?
[06/08/2025, 22.15.27] Ems : Nono you can
[06/08/2025, 22.15.34] Ems : It's omg that funny
[06/08/2025, 22.15.38] Ems : That's*
[06/08/2025, 22.15.39] Yousif Zaid: It is a bit feminine isn’t it
[06/08/2025, 22.15.43] Yousif Zaid: I’m seeing it now
[06/08/2025, 22.16.05] Ems : It was the whole "omg hold on"
[06/08/2025, 22.16.19] Yousif Zaid: Very zesty
[06/08/2025, 22.16.24] Ems : I read it in a 30 year old woman's voice
[06/08/2025, 22.16.34] Yousif Zaid: Was the woman English
[06/08/2025, 22.16.48] Ems : Unfortunately she was from California
[06/08/2025, 22.16.56] Yousif Zaid: :/
[06/08/2025, 22.17.12] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/08/2025, 22.17.21] Yousif Zaid: A leather fedora.
[06/08/2025, 22.17.50] Ems : You look like a modern Sherlock
[06/08/2025, 22.17.54] Ems : I don't know why
[06/08/2025, 22.18.11] Yousif Zaid: I don’t think you have the same associations about fedoras as I do
[06/08/2025, 22.18.23] Yousif Zaid: They might say Sherlock to you but to me it’s “worlds smelliest nerd”
[06/08/2025, 22.18.33] Ems : That's just the impression it gave
[06/08/2025, 22.18.37] Ems : For some reason
[06/08/2025, 22.18.53] Ems : Not if it's Benedict cumberbatch
[06/08/2025, 22.19.26] Yousif Zaid: Do you find Benedict cumberbatch handsome
[06/08/2025, 22.20.31] Ems : Handsome no but I think he has charm
[06/08/2025, 22.20.41] Ems : Opposite of Henry cavill
[06/08/2025, 22.20.44] Yousif Zaid: He’s definitely not smelly
[06/08/2025, 22.20.51] Yousif Zaid: Zero charm on super man?
[06/08/2025, 22.20.54] Ems : Definitely
[06/08/2025, 22.21.14] Ems : I don't know he's "charming" but meh
[06/08/2025, 22.21.56] Yousif Zaid: Laura is a lesbian but she has this strange obsession with

[06/08/2025, 22.22.24] Ems : You know I hate Star wars but yeah I like him
[06/08/2025, 22.22.31] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/08/2025, 22.22.39] Yousif Zaid: She’s completely fucking obsessed with the guy
[06/08/2025, 22.22.46] Yousif Zaid: She calls him “baby girl “
[06/08/2025, 22.22.55] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
[06/08/2025, 22.23.03] Yousif Zaid: She has a custom t shirt with his face on it
[06/08/2025, 22.23.18] Yousif Zaid: And the t shirt says baby girl, if I remember correctly
[06/08/2025, 22.23.21] Ems : That's a whole other level, but I would agree
[06/08/2025, 22.23.38] Ems : He's an example of both handsome and charming
[06/08/2025, 22.23.51] Yousif Zaid: Like in the movie?
[06/08/2025, 22.23.55] Yousif Zaid: Doesn’t he slaughter kids?
[06/08/2025, 22.24.07] Ems : I've only seen clips
[06/08/2025, 22.24.13] Ems : That's details
[06/08/2025, 22.24.15] Yousif Zaid: He kills a bunch of kids
[06/08/2025, 22.24.21] Yousif Zaid: And their mothers too
[06/08/2025, 22.24.29] Ems : Well still
[06/08/2025, 22.24.42] Yousif Zaid: I fucking hate Star Wars in a much more profound way
[06/08/2025, 22.24.50] Yousif Zaid: I will tell you the story in Rome
[06/08/2025, 22.25.06] Ems : No you told me it's bad
[06/08/2025, 22.25.20] Yousif Zaid: That’s right!
[06/08/2025, 22.25.21] Ems : What the fuck
[06/08/2025, 22.25.37] Yousif Zaid: I feel nausea when I think of Star Wars
[06/08/2025, 22.25.48] Ems : image omitted
[06/08/2025, 22.25.50] Yousif Zaid: I like that Beth Harmon from queens gambit
[06/08/2025, 22.26.27] Ems : You have an obsession with Anya Taylor joy
[06/08/2025, 22.26.44] Yousif Zaid: I really don’t know if I would call it that
[06/08/2025, 22.27.18] Ems : She is very cool I like her
[06/08/2025, 22.27.24] Ems : One of the best characters
[06/08/2025, 22.27.39] Yousif Zaid: I still want to stress that this is inaccurate
[06/08/2025, 22.28.07] Ems : Okok
[06/08/2025, 23.47.00] Yousif Zaid: I just finished “Youth”, the short story in there and it’s completely electrifying. You have got to read this shit
[07/08/2025, 01.26.14] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 07.56.01] Ems : Ok keep it for me for when I get back
[07/08/2025, 07.56.09] Ems : Hahahahahahahahah
[07/08/2025, 07.56.15] Ems : I think you should go
[07/08/2025, 08.20.03] Yousif Zaid: I need to think of some kind of excuse not to go
[07/08/2025, 10.02.30] Ems : But why? Don't you want to see Benson on stage
[07/08/2025, 10.02.41] Ems : His whole dirty American act
[07/08/2025, 11.02.20] Yousif Zaid: Covering himself in dirt on purpose
[07/08/2025, 11.02.37] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 11.06.29] Yousif Zaid: I feel manly as hell
[07/08/2025, 11.10.05] Ems : Look at that
[07/08/2025, 11.10.37] Ems : You're very versatile when it comes to what you do at work
[07/08/2025, 11.10.50] Ems : It's either read or do something completely random
[07/08/2025, 11.20.01] Yousif Zaid: I love helping the handyman out
[07/08/2025, 11.20.20] Yousif Zaid: He’s an old Danish bloke named Henrik who makes racist jokes and rewards my manual labour with cigarettes
[07/08/2025, 11.22.33] Ems : Is he the same one that walked in on you studying for exams?
[07/08/2025, 11.22.58] Yousif Zaid: Several people have done that but he is one of them yes
[07/08/2025, 11.23.08] Yousif Zaid: On your way to ponza?

[07/08/2025, 11.28.25] Ems : Oh it really is how cool is that
[07/08/2025, 11.28.26] Ems : Whose is it?
[07/08/2025, 11.28.44] Yousif Zaid: Just a photo I found online
[07/08/2025, 11.28.57] Yousif Zaid: How long are you staying? You’re very active this summer. Moving about
[07/08/2025, 11.29.28] Ems : I thought you'd seen it around and asked to take a picture it was hilarious in my mind
[07/08/2025, 11.29.37] Ems : About 3 days
[07/08/2025, 11.29.41] Yousif Zaid: I would have stolen it

[07/08/2025, 12.17.22] Ems : Why are you so bored today
[07/08/2025, 13.02.07] Yousif Zaid: They keep asking me to come in and not giving me enough to do
[07/08/2025, 13.02.16] Yousif Zaid: I just took an hour long lunch break
[07/08/2025, 14.47.08] Ems : I was sleeping on the train
[07/08/2025, 14.49.30] Ems : image omitted
[07/08/2025, 16.56.03] Ems : Yousif I have news
[07/08/2025, 16.56.25] Yousif Zaid: Yes??
[07/08/2025, 16.56.43] Ems : I got the math 1 ta job!!
[07/08/2025, 16.57.03] Ems : The head of math sent me an email
[07/08/2025, 16.58.00] Yousif Zaid: Congratulations!!!!! I’m in the middle of eating tacos and I got up and washed my hands so I could text you
[07/08/2025, 16.58.21] Yousif Zaid: Never had a single doubt in my mind
[07/08/2025, 16.58.26] Yousif Zaid: It was written for you
[07/08/2025, 16.59.05] Yousif Zaid: You’re gonna do so well I’m sure, you did good teaching me some stuff when we were studying
[07/08/2025, 16.59.19] Ems : I'm very honoured you did that
[07/08/2025, 16.59.28] Ems : I hope so
[07/08/2025, 17.00.04] Yousif Zaid: When do you start ?
[07/08/2025, 17.02.23] Ems : I think first week
[07/08/2025, 17.02.33] Ems : Like the ones last year did
[07/08/2025, 17.04.24] Ems : I realize now this text seemed like much bigger news
[07/08/2025, 17.09.10] Yousif Zaid: Honestly I was like “somebody is pregnant”
[07/08/2025, 17.12.18] Yousif Zaid: I’ve had to apologize to Jim today
[07/08/2025, 17.31.03] Ems : What happened?
[07/08/2025, 17.31.26] Yousif Zaid: I’ve read your letter 3 times so far. I really love your handwriting even though it’s difficult for me to read (I’ve never been good at that, Sebastian is an actual calligrapher and I still can’t read his writing). Reading about your summer made up for the uneventful one I’ve had so far, but I’m sure coming to Rome will change that. I found the bakers academy paper very charming, was that just something they’ve had laying around in the boat? I was very nervous to open the letter for some reason, took me about half an hour to do so
[07/08/2025, 17.34.12] Yousif Zaid: For the past 9 days or so I’ve been getting home from work, checking the mailbox and texting him “fuck you” when I find it empty
[07/08/2025, 18.14.49] Ems : I'm so happy it arrived I admit I had lost hope
[07/08/2025, 18.15.18] Ems : The letter had very high standards to live up to after about 2-3 weeks of waiting
[07/08/2025, 18.15.38] Ems : Did you actually? Hahahahahs
[07/08/2025, 19.03.55] Yousif Zaid: I was still hopeful. Somehow knowing the Greek were lazy made the whole thing make sense
[07/08/2025, 19.04.24] Yousif Zaid: It was really lovely, although there is one sentence I can’t understand no matter how many times I read it
[07/08/2025, 19.04.38] Yousif Zaid: You said it was personal
[07/08/2025, 19.17.07] Ems : video omitted
[07/08/2025, 19.17.11] Ems : Send it over I'll translate
[07/08/2025, 19.17.18] Ems : It was well done
[07/08/2025, 19.43.58] Yousif Zaid: No longer an old lady? Ponza nightlife? I think I’ll go for a run and do nerd stuff. Maybe we’ll do mini golf this weekend
[07/08/2025, 19.44.06] Yousif Zaid: Is this a high school friend?
[07/08/2025, 20.02.22] Ems : I was never an old lady I do half and half
[07/08/2025, 20.02.48] Ems : I heard about the minigolf I'm very jealous
[07/08/2025, 20.02.59] Ems : Yes
[07/08/2025, 20.03.22] Ems : We're going to meet up with others tonight
[07/08/2025, 20.23.29] Yousif Zaid: Ponza is probably at least as good
[07/08/2025, 20.24.16] Yousif Zaid: Have fun. My good news of the day is that johns daughter knows me by name now [07/08/2025, 20.28.59] Ems : What that's amazing actually
[07/08/2025, 20.29.10] Ems : .
[07/08/2025, 20.29.50] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 20.30.15] Yousif Zaid: She’s the cutest thing I’m very happy that I’m “uncle Yousif”. It’s very precious
[07/08/2025, 20.31.11] Ems : Can you please record a vocal message?
[07/08/2025, 20.32.37] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted

[07/08/2025, 20.56.16] Yousif Zaid: Sunset dissapeared for the most part but it was like a lightbulb into the dark sky
[07/08/2025, 21.08.16] Yousif Zaid: I’m being followed by foxes i gotta get outta these woods
[07/08/2025, 21.12.57] Ems : Get out then do it
[07/08/2025, 21.13.10] Yousif Zaid: I made it out
[07/08/2025, 21.13.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 21.13.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 21.15.49] Ems : Are you still out? A cat just randomly jumped into our apartment
[07/08/2025, 21.16.11] Yousif Zaid: Yes ma’am. You should keep the cat
[07/08/2025, 21.17.27] Ems : How tf are you still out
[07/08/2025, 21.17.59] Yousif Zaid: Nothing else to do I guess ? I like walking and listening to music
[07/08/2025, 21.18.04] Yousif Zaid: I even brought my book with me but it’s too dark
[07/08/2025, 21.18.42] Yousif Zaid: I’ve never been so close to a fox before. There was like 3 of them
[07/08/2025, 21.18.50] Yousif Zaid: Running in and out of bushes near me
[07/08/2025, 21.25.28] Ems : You're becoming very mysterious with your night endeavours
[07/08/2025, 21.26.00] Yousif Zaid: I just walk around and greet animals I’m not like mr cigarette behind the ear architect
[07/08/2025, 21.27.47] Yousif Zaid: I dropped in to Dimitri and Soheyl and Jaap’s group for the tech society course
[07/08/2025, 21.27.53] Yousif Zaid: Saddest sight I’ve ever seen
[07/08/2025, 21.28.23] Yousif Zaid: Soheyl and Jaap arguing with a retarded TA and dmitri staring off into space and João looking for jobs on LinkedIn
[07/08/2025, 21.31.29] Ems : I'm going to day I don't envy you guys right now
[07/08/2025, 21.31.57] Yousif Zaid: You shouldn’t
[07/08/2025, 21.32.24] Ems : I kind of do because I'm tired
[07/08/2025, 21.32.31] Yousif Zaid: I had to watch Soheyl and Jaap argue on whether creating jobs helped the “no poverty” UN goal or the “good economy” UN goal
[07/08/2025, 21.32.42] Yousif Zaid: It’s the kind of shit that would make me tear my hair out
[07/08/2025, 21.33.13] Yousif Zaid: Vacation fatigue?
[07/08/2025, 21.46.09] Ems : Kind of
[07/08/2025, 21.46.26] Yousif Zaid: Hold on I’m home
[07/08/2025, 21.46.40] Ems : Like my friend was tired so I'm going out
[07/08/2025, 21.46.48] Ems : Still
[07/08/2025, 21.46.52] Yousif Zaid: Alone?
[07/08/2025, 21.47.57] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 21.54.53] Ems : I said, "I was really happy to be able to see Italy through their eyes though"
[07/08/2025, 21.54.54] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/08/2025, 21.55.02] Yousif Zaid: Ahhhhhh
[07/08/2025, 21.55.02] Ems : Visiting
[07/08/2025, 21.55.12] Yousif Zaid: I feel stupid now
[07/08/2025, 22.06.40] Ems : No my handwriting is illegible
[07/08/2025, 22.06.54] Yousif Zaid: I really like the g’s
[07/08/2025, 22.18.13] Ems : Now you're lying
[07/08/2025, 22.18.35] Yousif Zaid: No I really do, also the E in your signature
[07/08/2025, 22.18.40] Yousif Zaid: ?
[07/08/2025, 22.19.25] Ems : That e cursive, I always thought it looked better
[07/08/2025, 22.19.55] Ems : I'm going to meet up with friends, why?
[07/08/2025, 22.20.18] Yousif Zaid: Ahhh okay I was confused cuz u said your friend was too tired
[07/08/2025, 22.20.40] Yousif Zaid: Okay okay have fun then, I’ll read and maybe do some nerd stuff, goodnight ems
[07/08/2025, 22.21.44] Ems : It's both things, one friend was too tired so I'm meeting another one
[07/08/2025, 22.21.52] Ems : Night yuyu
[07/08/2025, 22.22.32] Ems : Let me know what you do with your nerd stuff
[08/08/2025, 10.01.44] Yousif Zaid: Didn’t end up achieving anything worth showing, but today I will make something called a “recurrent neural network”, it’s a bit smarter than what I’ve been doing before and should get us better names
[08/08/2025, 10.22.45] Yousif Zaid: How was last night? Laura and her girlfriend went to a chappel roan concert last night and I’m pretty sure they’re about to break up
[08/08/2025, 11.22.50] Ems : Ok I'll wait to see it
[08/08/2025, 11.23.23] Ems : Last night was quite nice, I think we're going to do something today, yesterday we were in bed quite early
[08/08/2025, 11.23.32] Ems : What happened with Laura??
[08/08/2025, 11.38.40] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know they went to the concert together right
[08/08/2025, 11.39.49] Yousif Zaid: They see each other and don’t kiss hello, and proceed to spend the entire time just kind of standing next to each other and looking at the concert
[08/08/2025, 11.40.01] Yousif Zaid: They don’t speak to each other no small talk it’s just awkward
[08/08/2025, 11.40.36] Yousif Zaid: It’s the weirdest shit they match on a dating app and keep dating and seeing each other and yet they just don’t seem to get alone
[08/08/2025, 11.40.42] Yousif Zaid: The other girl isn’t affectionate at all
[08/08/2025, 11.40.56] Yousif Zaid: So I think Laura will call her today and break things off
[08/08/2025, 12.00.13] Ems : Wait I thought they really got along
[08/08/2025, 12.00.33] Ems : That might be the right decision
[08/08/2025, 12.00.33] Ems : I'm sorry for Laura
[08/08/2025, 12.00.40] Yousif Zaid: The other girl isn’t affectionate and just can’t seem to be lovey dovey or whatever
[08/08/2025, 12.00.55] Ems : Are you going minigolfing today?
[08/08/2025, 12.01.16] Yousif Zaid: Like she says “want to be my girlfriend”. Laura is like “want to see each other before I go to France?” And she replies “aren’t we already both going to that concert?”
[08/08/2025, 12.01.28] Yousif Zaid: What kinda shit is that
[08/08/2025, 12.01.41] Yousif Zaid: If the plan actually happens, then yes, I’m dressed to go out
[08/08/2025, 12.01.55] Ems : What that's awful the fuck
[08/08/2025, 12.02.22] Ems : I think Laura is making the right call
[08/08/2025, 12.02.30] Yousif Zaid: And I have a sneaking suspicion that I call Laura pretty more often than this girl does
[08/08/2025, 12.02.57] Yousif Zaid: She’s just not very romantic
[08/08/2025, 12.03.19] Yousif Zaid: What’s the plan?
[08/08/2025, 12.05.23] Ems : Well a friend invited us on a boat so that's where I am right now, then I think it's apertif at sunset on a terrace and maybe club tonight? I'm not too sure about the club though because you know how I am when it gets late
[08/08/2025, 12.06.58] Yousif Zaid: That sounds really lovely. If the mini golf plans don’t work out I’m at least going to eat this big sandwich with dmitri called “the bazooka”
[08/08/2025, 12.07.04] Yousif Zaid: So I don’t waste today’s outfit
[08/08/2025, 12.09.21] Ems : What is in this sandwich
[08/08/2025, 12.09.28] Ems : The bazooka
[08/08/2025, 12.09.32] Ems : Of course
[08/08/2025, 12.09.45] Yousif Zaid: It’s a kebab but it’s the size of my forearm
[08/08/2025, 12.10.01] Yousif Zaid: And thicker than my bicep, or so Dimitri tells me
[08/08/2025, 12.13.33] Ems : I want proof when you get it
[08/08/2025, 12.13.53] Ems : This morning we bought a 10 euro watermelon
[08/08/2025, 12.14.05] Yousif Zaid: Dmitri could be exaggerating I’m not going to hold myself accountable
[08/08/2025, 12.14.14] Ems : How the fuck is a watermelon 10 euros
[08/08/2025, 12.14.17] Ems : Okok
[08/08/2025, 12.14.19] Yousif Zaid: Did it have 5 euros inside of it
[08/08/2025, 12.26.15] Ems : You'd think right
[08/08/2025, 13.31.37] Yousif Zaid: Mini golf not happening today; bazooka only
[08/08/2025, 13.31.58] Yousif Zaid: Sofia raced somebody on the way back from lunch and fell and ate shit
[08/08/2025, 13.32.55] Yousif Zaid: Had to bring her to my office and bring out the first aid kit where Dmitri patched up her knee and palms
[08/08/2025, 13.54.37] Ems : Awww
[08/08/2025, 13.54.53] Ems : All jokes aside is she ok?
[08/08/2025, 13.56.07] Yousif Zaid: She’s fine it was literally just a scratch
[08/08/2025, 13.56.30] Yousif Zaid: We were walking to the reception to get the first aid and Dimitri’s like “yousif go get first aid I’ll take care of it in the kitchen”
[08/08/2025, 13.56.38] Yousif Zaid: Aye aye Captain fuck me I guess
[08/08/2025, 13.56.51] Yousif Zaid: Put an entire roll of bandage around her knee
[08/08/2025, 13.57.18] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAH
[08/08/2025, 13.57.29] Ems : Such a knight
[08/08/2025, 13.57.42] Ems : This is one of the best things you've ever said
[08/08/2025, 13.57.51] Yousif Zaid: Put plasters on both her palms
[08/08/2025, 13.58.01] Ems : That's really ridiculous
[08/08/2025, 13.58.02] Ems : Aw
[08/08/2025, 13.58.03] Yousif Zaid: She was bleeding a little bit but like
[08/08/2025, 13.58.08] Ems : Do you see it now?
[08/08/2025, 13.58.22] Yousif Zaid: Yeah. Couldn’t do anything but listen
[08/08/2025, 13.58.42] Yousif Zaid: Try to let my boy shine
[08/08/2025, 13.59.01] Yousif Zaid: It was so fucking funny and awkward we were all in the kitchen during a busy time in the office
[08/08/2025, 13.59.05] Yousif Zaid: Whole group is standing there
[08/08/2025, 13.59.18] Yousif Zaid: Dmitri is hard at work he’s promising to stitch up her jeans that ripped
[08/08/2025, 13.59.36] Yousif Zaid: Silence. Soheyl points at a plate of melon on the table and is like “is this for everybody?”
[08/08/2025, 13.59.44] Yousif Zaid: I fucking died laughing
[08/08/2025, 14.00.21] Yousif Zaid: It was like, somebodies melon. He took pieces with his bare hands
[08/08/2025, 14.03.58] Ems : Hahahahahahah
[08/08/2025, 14.04.16] Ems : God i can see everyone's role in this so perfectly
[08/08/2025, 14.04.33] Ems : Is everyone already there? Am I the only one still away?
[08/08/2025, 14.04.48] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[08/08/2025, 14.06.10] Yousif Zaid: Funniest thing I’ve heard all week
[08/08/2025, 14.07.38] Ems : Gotta love him
[08/08/2025, 14.07.54] Yousif Zaid: But yeah besides that I think everyone is here

[08/08/2025, 14.12.43] Ems : I think 29th(?)
[08/08/2025, 14.13.31] Yousif Zaid: I hope we’ll have time to do fun stuff at the beginning of the semester and that it’s not so bad
[08/08/2025, 14.14.19] Ems : If you're back on like 30th or something there's intro parties
[08/08/2025, 14.14.42] Yousif Zaid: I think Claudio booked us home on the 1st?
[08/08/2025, 14.14.58] Yousif Zaid: Intro parties? Did you enjoy the first one ?
[08/08/2025, 14.16.59] Yousif Zaid: I checked with the boy we’re back the 30th at 17:30 [08/08/2025, 14.20.05] Ems : Eh some were ok I wouldn't mind going again

[08/08/2025, 14.20.55] Yousif Zaid: That’s true
[08/08/2025, 14.21.13] Yousif Zaid: Never a bad thing to try, if it sucks we can all just leave
[08/08/2025, 14.23.50] Yousif Zaid: Me and Jaap found out we have all the same courses. We’ll follow each other around holding hands

[08/08/2025, 17.37.48] Ems : They know their shit
[08/08/2025, 17.38.03] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[08/08/2025, 17.38.13] Ems : Ok the point is proven
[08/08/2025, 17.38.23] Ems : This is so cute
[08/08/2025, 17.38.34] Ems : Wow that is a bazooka
[08/08/2025, 17.38.40] Ems : The name makes sense
[08/08/2025, 17.40.31] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[08/08/2025, 17.40.35] Yousif Zaid: Our times
[08/08/2025, 17.41.48] Yousif Zaid: You won’t be surprised to hear that I feel like shit
[08/08/2025, 17.42.33] Ems : Wait João is 9 mins, Dimitri is 34?
[08/08/2025, 17.42.43] Yousif Zaid: No
[08/08/2025, 17.42.44] Ems : I am in fact not surprised
[08/08/2025, 17.42.47] Yousif Zaid: Dmitri finished after 34
[08/08/2025, 17.42.52] Yousif Zaid: I finished 2 min after that
[08/08/2025, 17.43.01] Yousif Zaid: And João finished 9 minutes after me
[08/08/2025, 17.43.20] Ems : Good times actually
[08/08/2025, 17.43.26] Ems : Very impressive
[08/08/2025, 17.43.43] Ems : And I don't even know how a kebab can be that long
[08/08/2025, 17.44.22] Yousif Zaid: Ems my stomach is killing me
[08/08/2025, 17.44.49] Ems : Your tummy aches
[08/08/2025, 17.45.01] Ems : Not worse that the chicken look at the bright side
[08/08/2025, 17.46.15] Yousif Zaid: It’s about on that level

[08/08/2025, 17.53.48] Ems : I bet somebody is going to throw up while driving
[08/08/2025, 17.54.29] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted
[08/08/2025, 18.01.30] Yousif Zaid: They want to go out into the city and I don’t have it in me
[08/08/2025, 18.04.24] Ems : You would probably drunk drive better
[08/08/2025, 18.04.35] Ems : Yousif it's Friday go have a beer
[08/08/2025, 18.04.52] Yousif Zaid: Already on my way home
[08/08/2025, 18.04.58] Yousif Zaid: I feel terrible
[08/08/2025, 18.05.21] Yousif Zaid: Also we’re going out tomorrow
[08/08/2025, 18.05.48] Ems : You're more of an old lady than me at the end of the day
[08/08/2025, 18.21.50] Yousif Zaid: I was gonna say today I’m an old man
[08/08/2025, 18.21.57] Yousif Zaid: Social battery is a bit dead too
[08/08/2025, 18.41.21] Yousif Zaid: It just started raining cats and dogs too. Glad I did the old man move
[08/08/2025, 19.27.31] Ems : It's the kebab for sure
[08/08/2025, 19.28.03] Yousif Zaid: Nah you know I start checking out of social occasions relatively soon
[08/08/2025, 19.33.47] Ems : True you do one outing per week max
[08/08/2025, 19.34.08] Ems : And that's also too much
[08/08/2025, 19.34.21] Yousif Zaid: Come on now what do you think of me
[08/08/2025, 19.34.44] Yousif Zaid: Its less bad than that. Not much less but still less
[08/08/2025, 19.35.06] Ems : "there comes a time"
[08/08/2025, 19.35.18] Yousif Zaid: There comes a time in a man’s life
[08/08/2025, 19.35.22] Yousif Zaid: And it gets to a point
[08/08/2025, 19.35.49] Yousif Zaid: Honest to god parties are an exception. I really loved distortion
[08/08/2025, 19.36.09] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[08/08/2025, 19.41.09] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[08/08/2025, 20.05.11] Ems : This was very very fun
[08/08/2025, 20.05.17] Ems : Distortion was peak
[08/08/2025, 20.05.32] Ems : Oh fuck poor Laura
[08/08/2025, 20.07.34] Yousif Zaid: Yeah Laura left her
[08/08/2025, 20.07.54] Yousif Zaid: She’s not too sad about it, more just relieved she doesn’t have to deal with it anymore
[08/08/2025, 20.08.28] Ems : Good for her
[08/08/2025, 20.08.31] Ems : I'm happy
[08/08/2025, 20.08.41] Ems : This is such a cute picture
[08/08/2025, 20.08.53] Yousif Zaid: It really is, I don’t remember taking it
[08/08/2025, 20.09.30] Yousif Zaid: It’s so bizarre to see a woman doing the whole “emotionally unavailable dude” cliché
[08/08/2025, 20.09.42] Yousif Zaid: You’d think two lesbians would be all over each other
[08/08/2025, 20.13.31] Ems : Nowadays the lesbians have shifted to it I think
[08/08/2025, 20.13.44] Yousif Zaid: Tough times
[08/08/2025, 20.13.49] Yousif Zaid: Climate change and all that
[08/08/2025, 20.13.53] Ems : We live in a society
[08/08/2025, 20.13.55] Yousif Zaid: It’s a lot to handle
[08/08/2025, 20.19.59] Ems : I'm pulling the old woman move as well I think
[08/08/2025, 20.20.08] Ems : We were supposed to go to a club
[08/08/2025, 20.20.18] Ems : It opens at midnight there's no way
[08/08/2025, 20.20.28] Yousif Zaid: Opens at midnight?
[08/08/2025, 20.20.28] Ems : I think we're just going out for a bit
[08/08/2025, 20.20.41] Ems : It's not happening
[08/08/2025, 20.20.49] Yousif Zaid: I remember taking the ferry from Sweden to Denmark at like 1 am
[08/08/2025, 20.21.07] Yousif Zaid: And seeing a crowd of Swedish women all dressed up ready to start their night of clubbing in Denmark
[08/08/2025, 20.21.25] Yousif Zaid: And all I could think was “it gets to a point man”
[08/08/2025, 20.21.59] Yousif Zaid: I’ll start HoD and get the nerd shit done so I have some nicer names to show you
[08/08/2025, 20.32.50] Ems : It really does
[08/08/2025, 20.33.00] Ems : I'll wait for them

[09/08/2025, 01.06.11] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[09/08/2025, 01.06.29] Yousif Zaid: it still is much better than before, and the names are better

[09/08/2025, 01.07.20] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[09/08/2025, 01.07.54] Yousif Zaid: i'm a bit fried so goodnight! sorry for the rant
[09/08/2025, 08.42.43] Ems : This is making so much progress
[09/08/2025, 08.43.02] Ems : The multidimensional aspect is getting complicated but very interesting
[09/08/2025, 08.43.14] Ems : Wait these look so much better
[09/08/2025, 08.43.37] Ems : It basically looks like a normal list of names
[09/08/2025, 10.12.39] Yousif Zaid: Thank you thank you. I’m done with the name maker thing for now. I think I’ll switch to modelling something else. Maybe do a Shakespeare maker
[09/08/2025, 10.14.04] Yousif Zaid: How was last night?
[09/08/2025, 12.06.58] Ems : Oh wow
[09/08/2025, 12.07.02] Ems : What would that do
[09/08/2025, 12.07.30] Ems : It was nice, we ended up walking around we didn't drink
[09/08/2025, 12.08.05] Ems : Tonight we're going to a terrace
[09/08/2025, 12.10.26] Yousif Zaid: You give it all of shakespeares works and it starts babbling Shakespeare sounding things. Like a terrible chatgpt that can only ramble in Shakespearean
[09/08/2025, 12.11.01] Yousif Zaid: I think I’ll go gym and then read and mini golf with the rest
[09/08/2025, 12.11.16] Yousif Zaid: Italy is in 9 days my excitement is growing
[09/08/2025, 12.21.04] Ems : Oh that sounds so fun
Also easier cause you can just copy paste shakespeare works as input instead of writing down names
[09/08/2025, 12.21.22] Ems : Although you probably took those from a list as well
[09/08/2025, 12.21.32] Ems : Very productive yuyu
[09/08/2025, 12.21.50] Ems : Wow it's so soon I didn't realise
[09/08/2025, 12.21.59] Ems : All packed and ready to go?
[09/08/2025, 12.22.28] Ems : video omitted
[09/08/2025, 13.15.02] Yousif Zaid: It’s all on a website already. People do this kinda thing often. I’m also gonna use something called a transformer which is the T in chatgpt
[09/08/2025, 13.15.09] Yousif Zaid: Yes I can’t think of 32,000 names
[09/08/2025, 13.15.41] Yousif Zaid: No. It’s a bit of a trouble. Claudio tells me I can’t pack 12 days worth of clothes because everything should fit in his car trunk so the car doesn’t get broken into
[09/08/2025, 13.16.05] Yousif Zaid: You’re trying to get me to kill myself but I won’t let it work on me
[09/08/2025, 13.16.33] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[09/08/2025, 14.26.25] Ems : What I do is just bring staples and switch around to make outfits
[09/08/2025, 14.26.43] Ems : Enjoy
[09/08/2025, 14.27.07] Ems : If it makes you feel any better it's so hot you can't walk around
[09/08/2025, 14.27.40] Yousif Zaid: I will have to do a load of laundry at some point I think
[09/08/2025, 14.27.59] Yousif Zaid: It doesn’t really help but I appreciate the sentiment
[09/08/2025, 14.28.53] Yousif Zaid: Love story is blasting in my ears during back day
[09/08/2025, 14.29.32] Ems : It should it's barely breathable
[09/08/2025, 14.29.44] Ems : That really gets the energy up
[09/08/2025, 14.30.33] Yousif Zaid: The other Arab men in here are looking at me funny
[09/08/2025, 14.31.42] Ems : Do you think the song is so loud they can hear it
[09/08/2025, 14.31.55] Yousif Zaid: My singing probably isn’t helping ahahhahaha
[09/08/2025, 14.32.02] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[09/08/2025, 14.32.09] Ems : You got this
[09/08/2025, 14.32.13] Ems : Look at them funny
[09/08/2025, 14.32.28] Yousif Zaid: It’s really weird there’s like a noticeable difference between us
[09/08/2025, 14.32.45] Yousif Zaid: They have very large beards and no moustache and I have the opposite thing going on
[09/08/2025, 14.34.52] Ems : Why would you shave a mustache and keep the beard it seems out of place
[09/08/2025, 14.34.54] Ems : No?
[09/08/2025, 14.35.28] Yousif Zaid: Its a common thing with the more traditional types? The Amish, Russian Muslims, that kinda thing
[09/08/2025, 14.36.31] Yousif Zaid: I’m looking forward to mini golf
[09/08/2025, 14.36.45] Ems : Yeah true now that you say it
[09/08/2025, 14.37.04] Ems : I think it's going to be fun, how many people are going?
[09/08/2025, 14.38.34] Yousif Zaid: I have no idea. I just know Soheyl is gonna take us to a hipster bar right after
[09/08/2025, 14.38.38] Yousif Zaid: Full of architect types
[09/08/2025, 14.38.44] Yousif Zaid: 90 dkk exotic pink beers
[09/08/2025, 14.39.21] Yousif Zaid: It’s a fetish for him
[09/08/2025, 14.45.10] Ems : Of course
[09/08/2025, 14.45.18] Ems : Places like åben and brus
[09/08/2025, 14.45.47] Ems : If you see anyone with a cigarette behind the ear call them out
[09/08/2025, 14.45.52] Ems : Please
[09/08/2025, 14.46.09] Yousif Zaid: Bootleggers too if we’re honest
[09/08/2025, 14.46.15] Yousif Zaid: You just give it a pass because of the popcorn
[09/08/2025, 14.46.26] Ems : I was going to say
[09/08/2025, 14.46.31] Ems : It has popcorn
[09/08/2025, 14.46.41] Ems : Let's leave bootleggers out of this
[09/08/2025, 14.46.44] Ems : But yes
[09/08/2025, 14.47.05] Yousif Zaid: My kind of bar is kinda gross but the beers are 35 dkk
[09/08/2025, 14.47.12] Yousif Zaid: And you can smoke indoors
[09/08/2025, 14.47.28] Ems : Wall street pub has 25 kr pints
[09/08/2025, 14.47.31] Ems : I'm just saying
[09/08/2025, 14.48.27] Yousif Zaid: Yeah but it’s filled with nonces and nonce victims
[09/08/2025, 14.48.47] Yousif Zaid: Are you a nonce or a victim? I’m neither so I stay away
[09/08/2025, 14.51.27] Ems : I still think the option to sit outside is solid
[09/08/2025, 14.51.37] Ems : We always end up sitting outside anyway
[09/08/2025, 14.55.30] Yousif Zaid: I think we should be visiting parks more often
[09/08/2025, 14.55.49] Yousif Zaid: An 18 pack, in the botanical gardens
[09/08/2025, 14.56.02] Yousif Zaid: Good group activity
[09/08/2025, 14.58.07] Ems : Team Building
[09/08/2025, 14.58.18] Yousif Zaid: Yes ma’am

[09/08/2025, 19.24.33] Ems : You do not
[09/08/2025, 19.24.34] Ems : I'm a bit late with the reply but I like the outfit
[09/08/2025, 21.08.42] Ems : The video of you pouring shots is so funny for no reason at all

[09/08/2025, 21.37.13] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[09/08/2025, 21.37.25] Yousif Zaid: I’m so fried
[09/08/2025, 21.38.06] Yousif Zaid: We’re at this amazing Chinese restaurant im drunk and I haven’t eaten all day this is gonna be a disaster
[09/08/2025, 21.47.31] Yousif Zaid: Who sent you the video
[09/08/2025, 21.56.57] Ems : Wow that was a whole hour before you realised
[09/08/2025, 21.57.13] Ems : How's your stomach?
[09/08/2025, 22.08.00] Yousif Zaid: Fucking great
[09/08/2025, 22.08.08] Yousif Zaid: This food is amazing I’m gonna take you here one day
[09/08/2025, 22.46.18] Ems : Wow I wasn't expecting that

[09/08/2025, 22.52.27] Ems : Are you guys in the meatpacking district?
[09/08/2025, 22.52.38] Ems : Of course soheyl would bring you there
[09/08/2025, 22.53.30] Yousif Zaid: Yes the mini golf course is there
[09/08/2025, 22.53.37] Yousif Zaid: I brought us to the Chinese place
[09/08/2025, 22.54.55] Yousif Zaid: It’s like the cliche where you look at the moon and wonder if someone else is also looking at it
[09/08/2025, 22.56.53] Ems : You're right, it's so so beautiful today
[09/08/2025, 23.32.10] Yousif Zaid: Sitting in the back of mityas car

[10/08/2025, 13.14.47] Ems : It was quite nice
[10/08/2025, 13.14.48] Ems : The sunset was beautiful
[10/08/2025, 13.14.48] Ems : Where did you guys drive to?
[10/08/2025, 13.18.58] Yousif Zaid: We dropped off Jaap at his house, then went to the woods near my parents house and sat on the trunk while I smoked and we chatted
[10/08/2025, 13.20.13] Yousif Zaid: I’ve never actually sat down in some moonlight before
[10/08/2025, 13.20.43] Yousif Zaid: My moms birthday is in two days, I’m gonna go shopping for a gift for her
[10/08/2025, 13.24.39] Ems : Sounds lovely
[10/08/2025, 13.24.48] Ems : Do you have a gift in mind?
[10/08/2025, 13.26.09] Yousif Zaid: She likes jewelry?
[10/08/2025, 13.26.14] Yousif Zaid: Otherwise I have no idea
[10/08/2025, 13.26.21] Yousif Zaid: Gold
[10/08/2025, 13.29.13] Yousif Zaid: What do you usually get your mom? [10/08/2025, 14.38.29] Ems : Ok if you send options I can advise I think a pair of cool earrings could be nice
[10/08/2025, 14.38.57] Ems : It's either something for the house she likes, jewellery or some kind of inside joke thing
[10/08/2025, 14.39.04] Yousif Zaid: That’s cool of you. You have good taste so it’s helpful
[10/08/2025, 14.39.11] Ems : I sometimes did some handmade stuff
[10/08/2025, 14.39.19] Ems : You could try that
[10/08/2025, 14.39.39] Yousif Zaid: You’ve seen my drawing skills and whatnot
[10/08/2025, 14.40.05] Yousif Zaid: I like the earring idea a lot
[10/08/2025, 14.40.20] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[10/08/2025, 14.40.49] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[10/08/2025, 14.41.00] Ems : He is at the chill level I aspire to be
[10/08/2025, 14.41.11] Yousif Zaid: A bum!
[10/08/2025, 14.43.09] Ems : Imagine how easy life would be if we were living like that
[10/08/2025, 14.43.12] Ems : I envy him
[10/08/2025, 14.43.13] Yousif Zaid: He has school tommorow morning at 8 am how the fuck is this gonna happen
[10/08/2025, 14.43.26] Ems : Isn't it summer holiday?
[10/08/2025, 14.43.34] Yousif Zaid: It’s over for him today
[10/08/2025, 14.43.49] Yousif Zaid: Realistically you could have been living this life if you really wanted
[10/08/2025, 14.44.11] Yousif Zaid: Born in Italy nice weather minimum wage job drink cheap wine and nap in the sun
[10/08/2025, 14.46.02] Ems : Realistically yes, but not really
[10/08/2025, 14.46.14] Ems : Wow
[10/08/2025, 14.46.29] Yousif Zaid: He got his holiday way before us don’t feel bad for him
[10/08/2025, 14.46.30] Ems : Marta has it until September 12th or something
[10/08/2025, 14.46.42] Ems : Ok I won't
[10/08/2025, 14.47.05] Yousif Zaid: Nobody forced you to come to Denmark and study engineering when the sun goes down at 2 pm in winter
[10/08/2025, 14.47.25] Yousif Zaid: The lion makes life hard for herself
[10/08/2025, 14.47.31] Ems : Now it just sounds like I'm not welcome there calm down
[10/08/2025, 14.47.35] Ems : She has to
[10/08/2025, 14.47.48] Yousif Zaid: No it was set up for the lion line
[10/08/2025, 14.47.54] Yousif Zaid: You did that shit on your own
[10/08/2025, 14.48.29] Yousif Zaid: I can just picture you sitting on a terrace with a spritz and randomly telling yourself “what if things were terrible and cold instead?” And you started packing
[10/08/2025, 14.49.10] Ems : I'm doing a whole migration today it's treacherous
[10/08/2025, 14.49.15] Ems : Cold is good
[10/08/2025, 14.49.22] Ems : This is what I've gathered
[10/08/2025, 14.49.26] Yousif Zaid: Tell me
[10/08/2025, 14.49.34] Ems : The spritz part is pretty spot on
[10/08/2025, 14.50.07] Ems : Ferry , train, metro, train, car
[10/08/2025, 14.50.08] Yousif Zaid: The heat is giving you brain damage?
[10/08/2025, 14.50.26] Ems : How do you know
[10/08/2025, 14.50.49] Yousif Zaid: Because you sent a message about the cold that a caveman would scratch onto a cave wall [10/08/2025, 14.51.27] Ems : I'm reverting back to basic brain functions
[10/08/2025, 14.51.34] Yousif Zaid: Cold is good
[10/08/2025, 14.51.36] Ems : video omitted
[10/08/2025, 14.51.43] Ems : It is indeed
[10/08/2025, 14.52.08] Yousif Zaid: The funniest thing about this is that you can’t see that at all you’re just suffering from heat stroke I think
[10/08/2025, 14.52.38] Yousif Zaid: The school children kicked their footballs at me while I was jogging
[10/08/2025, 14.53.19] Ems : Perhaps
[10/08/2025, 14.53.26] Ems : Did they laugh as well?
[10/08/2025, 14.53.36] Yousif Zaid: I imagined that they did so
[10/08/2025, 14.54.01] Yousif Zaid: Dug up some “picked last for the football team in the 2nd grade” trauma
[10/08/2025, 14.54.42] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 14.55.09] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 14.58.24] Ems : Wow
[10/08/2025, 14.58.29] Ems : That is something
[10/08/2025, 14.58.32] Ems : Mmm
[10/08/2025, 14.58.35] Ems : Wow
[10/08/2025, 14.58.39] Yousif Zaid: !!
[10/08/2025, 15.01.54] Ems : !!
[10/08/2025, 15.02.08] Ems : You were so blind it was so fucking funny
[10/08/2025, 15.02.29] Yousif Zaid: The less I can read people the better as far as I’m concerned
[10/08/2025, 15.04.39] Yousif Zaid: I don’t like noticing things
[10/08/2025, 15.06.48] Ems : Like do you prefer to live in a bubble
[10/08/2025, 15.16.03] Yousif Zaid: I prefer to only act on things people let me know on purpose
[10/08/2025, 15.16.22] Yousif Zaid: Unless it’s something like my friend clearly about to burst into tears or whatever but
[10/08/2025, 15.17.27] Ems : I think I'm just nosy then
[10/08/2025, 15.17.44] Yousif Zaid: If someone wants me to think a certain way about them I’m willing to believe it
[10/08/2025, 15.17.56] Yousif Zaid: I’m nosy too but it’s just blown up in my face too many times
[10/08/2025, 15.18.16] Yousif Zaid: I end up consoling a not so close friend over a breakup that I have nothing to do with
[10/08/2025, 15.18.33] Yousif Zaid: It always gets awkward when I stick my nose in somebody else’s business
[10/08/2025, 15.19.06] Ems : That's self preservation but sometimes knowing stuff you shouldn't know is better, as in you know how people really are
[10/08/2025, 15.20.02] Yousif Zaid: I get that, but my life isn’t really composed in such a way where I have to worry about backstabbers and manipulators and stuff
[10/08/2025, 15.20.41] Yousif Zaid: Jaap could be a psychopath for all I know but it’s not like he has my house keys, if you know what I’m trying to say
[10/08/2025, 15.21.31] Yousif Zaid: Does that make sense?
[10/08/2025, 15.22.26] Yousif Zaid: I try to be very clear about the signals I give out and I believe people and don’t look into things
[10/08/2025, 15.47.59] Ems : That's a really good thing, I think some of the people I went to high school with gave me reason to be like that
[10/08/2025, 15.48.03] Ems : Also I'm nosy
[10/08/2025, 16.06.32] Yousif Zaid: Maybe I’m just lucky but I’ve never had reason to be socially intelligent in that way, kind of like how pandas are retarded because they have no predators
[10/08/2025, 16.10.37] Yousif Zaid: I try to notice when people are upset or have been interrupted and that’s it
[10/08/2025, 16.11.23] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 16.23.27] Ems : Worth it?
[10/08/2025, 16.23.34] Yousif Zaid: Yeah kinda
[10/08/2025, 16.23.39] Ems : Oh that car is so cool
[10/08/2025, 16.23.52] Ems : You shouldn't even feel the pain while driving it
[10/08/2025, 16.23.58] Yousif Zaid: I asked my dad if I could take it out he said sure with a smirk I get in and it’s got no gas
[10/08/2025, 16.24.05] Yousif Zaid: -250 dkk
[10/08/2025, 16.24.53] Yousif Zaid: One day somebody will shoot me I was blasting 2011 the weeknd as loud as the car could go in residential neighborhoods
[10/08/2025, 16.25.04] Ems : You gotta respect that
[10/08/2025, 16.25.14] Yousif Zaid: I’m not even mad
[10/08/2025, 16.25.35] Ems : People can't get mad if you're in the audi
[10/08/2025, 16.25.45] Yousif Zaid: They get especially mad

[10/08/2025, 16.27.59] Ems : Yeah you're right
[10/08/2025, 16.30.14] Yousif Zaid: All this stuff seems like it’s for younger women if that makes sense
[10/08/2025, 16.30.51] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 16.31.19] Ems : If you're not convinced either change store or try online
[10/08/2025, 16.32.20] Yousif Zaid: I just asked for the price of something and was told that it was 170 thousand Danish kroner
[10/08/2025, 16.35.39] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 16.35.49] Yousif Zaid: On a side note I kind of like this for myself, am I crazy?
[10/08/2025, 16.37.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 16.39.16] Yousif Zaid: My mom is a very gold wearer, the green would probably go with her like, blonde/brown hair no?
[10/08/2025, 16.40.28] Ems : They are lovely
[10/08/2025, 16.40.32] Ems : I really like them
[10/08/2025, 16.40.48] Ems : Yes very
[10/08/2025, 16.41.10] Yousif Zaid: They have them in dark green like this or dark purple
[10/08/2025, 16.41.19] Ems : If you want more of the green vibe go with these
[10/08/2025, 16.41.32] Yousif Zaid: I think these are more sleek than the other ones
[10/08/2025, 16.41.41] Ems : The ones on the left here are more particular, the other ones more classic
[10/08/2025, 16.42.02] Ems : I think so
[10/08/2025, 16.42.08] Ems : Mm
[10/08/2025, 16.42.21] Ems : Do you have a picture of the purple?
[10/08/2025, 16.42.33] Ems : Even though I will always think green is superior
[10/08/2025, 16.42.36] Yousif Zaid: Am I trying to force the silver thing too hard? I’ll send photos of me wearing both tell me what looks better
[10/08/2025, 16.42.41] Yousif Zaid: I’ll get one
[10/08/2025, 16.42.55] Yousif Zaid: I’m picking up ayman from the hairdresser and we’ll go back to the jewelry place
[10/08/2025, 16.44.15] Ems : Ok I'll be driving in about ten minutes though
[10/08/2025, 16.44.33] Ems : And call me crazy but I don't text and drive

[10/08/2025, 18.11.28] Yousif Zaid: Can I tell you something dumb
[10/08/2025, 18.12.05] Yousif Zaid: When you told me you lost them in the sea I nearly got my mom to bring me those ones you liked from the states cuz they only ship there, as a birthday gift
[10/08/2025, 18.12.12] Yousif Zaid: Then you found them and I told her Nevermind
[10/08/2025, 18.12.22] Yousif Zaid: Then she came back to the states and you fucking sat on them
[10/08/2025, 18.12.33] Ems : No you didn't
[10/08/2025, 18.12.42] Ems : Thank you so much for the thought

[10/08/2025, 18.13.40] Ems : Can I tape them

[10/08/2025, 18.15.53] Yousif Zaid: My mom is in the kitchen cooking I just heard her ask my dad “what’s wrong with him he’s making noises”

[10/08/2025, 18.20.29] Ems : I can tell you it did not make mine
[10/08/2025, 18.21.02] Yousif Zaid: On the bright side you can go sunglasses shopping
[10/08/2025, 18.25.30] Ems : "bright side" after breaking my sunglasses must be on purpose

[10/08/2025, 18.39.02] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[10/08/2025, 18.39.13] Ems : It would've been a more poetic ending if they'd stayed in greece

[10/08/2025, 18.39.33] Yousif Zaid: I’m sorry

[10/08/2025, 18.40.01] Yousif Zaid: Getting sat on
[10/08/2025, 18.40.21] Ems : Also why tf is it in the middle of my forehead
[10/08/2025, 18.40.32] Yousif Zaid: Isn’t that where they put it
[10/08/2025, 18.40.38] Ems : Fucking shattered
[10/08/2025, 18.40.51] Ems : I feel like it's between the eyebrows
[10/08/2025, 18.40.56] Yousif Zaid: Oh wow I’m uneducated it’s closer to the eyebrows
[10/08/2025, 18.41.03] Yousif Zaid: Do you want me to make an adjustment?
[10/08/2025, 18.41.09] Ems : Don't you dare
[10/08/2025, 18.41.26] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know it seems like you care about me getting it right somehow
[10/08/2025, 18.41.51] Yousif Zaid: I’ll leave off it
[10/08/2025, 18.42.35] Ems : I wanted to underline your mistake there's a difference
[10/08/2025, 18.43.14] Yousif Zaid: I said I’d leave off it ! I don’t know what to do for the rest of the day I think I might read or learn a song on the guitar
[10/08/2025, 18.43.57] Ems : If it's a guitar song let it be from our boy benson
[10/08/2025, 18.44.08] Yousif Zaid: Fat fucking chance ems

[10/08/2025, 18.45.53] Ems : Which book
[10/08/2025, 18.45.55] Yousif Zaid: It’s so shit though??
[10/08/2025, 18.46.04] Yousif Zaid: Heart of darkness, been procrastinating
[10/08/2025, 18.46.24] Ems : Yes but in a catchy way
[10/08/2025, 18.46.31] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been trying to learn Rolling Stone by the weeknd but I am physically incapable of singing and playing it seems
[10/08/2025, 18.46.39] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been practicing for a while I just can’t do it
[10/08/2025, 18.47.16] Ems : I'm sure you can get it
[10/08/2025, 18.47.44] Yousif Zaid: Also I sent a clip of me singing it to Sebastian and he said it was “interesting” which is Sebastian for “you should kill yourself”
[10/08/2025, 18.47.54] Yousif Zaid: He can’t say anything bad about anything
[10/08/2025, 18.48.49] Ems : God bless him
[10/08/2025, 18.55.21] Yousif Zaid: Oh my god okay

[10/08/2025, 18.57.21] Yousif Zaid: My mom is all like “my condolences for your loss” and all that
[10/08/2025, 18.58.49] Yousif Zaid: They’re interrupted by a McDonald’s delivery driver showing up to deliver McDonald’s to ayman. Ayman comes down holding his gaming stuff and he walks up to this lady like “hey what’s up” excuse me I need to get to my McDonald’s and her dad died like 8 hours ago it was the most awkward thing I’ve seen in my life
[10/08/2025, 19.32.13] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
[10/08/2025, 19.32.32] Ems : That must have been the best thing ever
[10/08/2025, 19.33.09] Yousif Zaid: It was so hard not to burst out laughing in front of this poor girl man
[10/08/2025, 19.34.37] Ems : This is the kind of thing that would make me die on the spot
[10/08/2025, 19.34.46] Ems : I would've laughed 100%
[10/08/2025, 19.35.05] Yousif Zaid: The crunching noises the bag of McDonald’s made in the awkward silence as he waddled back up the stairs are gonna haunt me [10/08/2025, 19.41.38] Yousif Zaid: My brother is a psycho between this and the ambulance thing I’m not sure he can feel empathy
[10/08/2025, 19.47.44] Ems : I think he just doesn't give a fuck
[10/08/2025, 20.43.08] Yousif Zaid: You’ll have to show me your work with taping up the glasses
[10/08/2025, 21.31.01] Ems : I Will get on it tomorrow, it won't be impressive but it'll be something

[11/08/2025, 07.04.07] Ems : A little diva
[11/08/2025, 07.04.25] Ems : It's funny that you're basically the only one against it
[11/08/2025, 11.09.44] Yousif Zaid: I feel like I’m in a mental hospital
[11/08/2025, 11.09.58] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[11/08/2025, 14.55.11] Ems : How do they do it they should do experiments on themselves instead of random bullshit
[11/08/2025, 14.55.38] Yousif Zaid: Genuinely I don’t know
[11/08/2025, 14.55.43] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[11/08/2025, 14.55.54] Yousif Zaid: Spent all day working in the lab cleaning our mass spec
[11/08/2025, 15.10.34] Ems : You look very professional
[11/08/2025, 15.10.43] Ems : The purple gloves make the outfit
[11/08/2025, 15.10.54] Ems : Steeven sent me an email [11/08/2025, 15.11.10] Yousif Zaid: I was mixing isopropanol with water and pretending to be antoine Lavoisier
[11/08/2025, 15.11.34] Ems : Must have felt cool as shit
[11/08/2025, 15.11.49] Yousif Zaid: Ooh is it about the TA thing or does he intend to marry you
[11/08/2025, 15.12.09] Ems : Ta thing
[11/08/2025, 15.12.13] Ems : We'll see though
[11/08/2025, 15.12.36] Ems : He's not Indian so it wouldn't make you happy
[11/08/2025, 15.12.51] Yousif Zaid: He’s also a bit old [11/08/2025, 15.13.19] Yousif Zaid: Well what’s it say
[11/08/2025, 15.15.22] Ems : Meeting on the 28th
[11/08/2025, 15.15.36] Yousif Zaid: Aren’t you back on the 30th
[11/08/2025, 15.15.38] Yousif Zaid: No wait that’s me
[11/08/2025, 15.15.42] Yousif Zaid: When are you back
[11/08/2025, 15.41.05] Ems : Either 27th or 28th
[11/08/2025, 16.45.48] Ems : I've nearly finished blood meridian now that I'm back
[11/08/2025, 16.46.09] Ems : Kid is in San Diego and the judge is being a bitch as usual
[11/08/2025, 17.29.15] Yousif Zaid: Oh wow I just woke up from a monster nap the vision out my left eye is blurry [11/08/2025, 17.29.44] Yousif Zaid: I don’t remember them ever going to San Diego, what else recently happened in the plot
[11/08/2025, 17.40.01] Yousif Zaid: I finished the first section of HoD last night and it’s kind of eerie, not as much as blood meridian though
[11/08/2025, 18.08.08] Ems : I just finished the book
I really really liked it, both McCarthy's way of writing and the story I'm unsure on what to think about the ending, because although it was one of the best ways to end a book I'm thinking of interpretations
[11/08/2025, 18.08.56] Ems : I'm unsure of whether the judge murdered the kid or convinced him to rape and murder the little girl
[11/08/2025, 18.09.22] Ems : Also at the end you can really see how the judge is the personification of evil by the dance
[11/08/2025, 18.09.45] Ems : San Diego is when the kid has surgery
[11/08/2025, 18.30.22] Yousif Zaid: I think generally people read it as the judge killing and raping the kid
[11/08/2025, 18.30.47] Yousif Zaid: Please refresh my memory, what little girl? What makes you say this?
[11/08/2025, 18.38.21] Yousif Zaid: Yeah it’s pretty cut and dry with this. I remember the kid (the man) showing some sort of sympathy with strangers after his days with the Glanton gang, knowing this, how guilty do you think the kid is? When I first read the book I thought he was doing all that horrible shit but when i got to that part it made me doubt how involved he was
[11/08/2025, 18.51.56] Ems : There was a bear killed if you remember, and the little girl was crying because of this. Then she gets lost and people look for her while the kid goes to the jakes. Some men are horrified when they go to where the kid went but we don't know why
The judge then dances and shows how evil he is, so either he did something evil or convinced the kid to do so
[11/08/2025, 18.52.38] Ems : Yes exactly that's what I thought When you asked I didn't have faith in the kid, but towards the end he shows more empathy
[11/08/2025, 18.52.52] Yousif Zaid: Aren’t the men horrified because they see the mangled corpse of the kid?
[11/08/2025, 18.53.14] Ems : It doesn't say
[11/08/2025, 18.53.20] Ems : You can just assume
[11/08/2025, 18.53.20] Yousif Zaid: Kid goes to the Jake’s, the judge is there, holds him against his “terrible flesh”
[11/08/2025, 18.53.24] Yousif Zaid: Yes I assume
[11/08/2025, 18.53.36] Ems : Yeah
[11/08/2025, 18.53.41] Yousif Zaid: But I never thought about the little girl
[11/08/2025, 18.53.49] Yousif Zaid: What do you make of the epilogue
[11/08/2025, 18.54.24] Ems : I wanted to ask you
[11/08/2025, 18.54.46] Yousif Zaid: About the epilogue?
[11/08/2025, 18.55.10] Yousif Zaid: I think it’s about us “civilising” the frontier
[11/08/2025, 18.55.40] Yousif Zaid: Gunpowder is used to blow holes for railroads that connect towns together instead of being used to blow holes in Indians
[11/08/2025, 18.56.06] Yousif Zaid: It’s less violent, but more about control still, us wanting to control the world the same way the judge does
[11/08/2025, 18.56.58] Yousif Zaid: The entire Glanton gang is very violent but the judge stands out cause of his desire to control and overpower. It’s why he keeps targeting children, learning about the entire world, that kinda stuff [11/08/2025, 18.59.30] Yousif Zaid: I keep thinking about his story where the judge makes gunpowder out of a “dough” that’s made from bone dust and piss. It’s like a twisted inversion of like when Jesus gives out bread. In a way it still kind of saves them [11/08/2025, 19.03.09] Ems : That's a very good interpretation
[11/08/2025, 19.03.16] Ems : You're right
[11/08/2025, 19.03.35] Ems : I swear the judge was such a well constructed villain
[11/08/2025, 19.03.56] Yousif Zaid: Just the worst guy of all time
[11/08/2025, 19.04.15] Yousif Zaid: Does this seem silly? I swear there’s something there
[11/08/2025, 19.04.45] Ems : He kept getting more interesting every time he did something
[11/08/2025, 19.04.53] Ems : No it's not silly
[11/08/2025, 19.04.57] Ems : I agree totally
[11/08/2025, 19.05.02] Ems : It's actually really clever
[11/08/2025, 19.05.18] Yousif Zaid: I remember giggling when the judge is like
[11/08/2025, 19.05.26] Yousif Zaid: “Piss like your lives depend on it!!!”
[11/08/2025, 19.09.35] Yousif Zaid: I’m happy you read it it’s like my favourite book
[11/08/2025, 19.41.55] Ems : He's kind of an icon
[11/08/2025, 19.42.01] Ems : I'm so so glad you lent it
[11/08/2025, 19.42.06] Ems : The prose was beautiful
[11/08/2025, 19.42.14] Yousif Zaid: John is reading it too actually
[11/08/2025, 19.42.14] Ems : And it was really interesting
[11/08/2025, 19.42.28] Yousif Zaid: I’m honestly having trouble getting through my book
[11/08/2025, 19.42.35] Yousif Zaid: So is mine and I might sound dumb here but I legit don’t understand half the words in mine and I’m having trouble keeping track of the characters [11/08/2025, 19.59.25] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[11/08/2025, 20.54.19] Ems : It Is not dumb sometimes they're so cryptic
[11/08/2025, 20.54.28] Ems : What does he think
[11/08/2025, 20.54.41] Ems : Put a camera on when you do
[11/08/2025, 20.55.01] Yousif Zaid: I might disappear I should take someone with me
[11/08/2025, 20.55.18] Yousif Zaid: There was a mattress in there. Did you do anything interesting today? I feel like I wasted my day
[11/08/2025, 20.56.13] Ems : Don't feel bad the only productive thing I did was finish the book
[11/08/2025, 20.56.19] Ems : I don't think that counts
[11/08/2025, 20.56.30] Ems : We went shopping but I bought nothing
[11/08/2025, 20.56.38] Ems : And it was too hot to walk
[11/08/2025, 20.56.48] Yousif Zaid: I mean compared to just looking at your phone I think even watching a movie is productive
[11/08/2025, 20.57.25] Yousif Zaid: My brother is on the phone with someone in his room I just heard him say “are you fucking retarded?”
[11/08/2025, 20.57.57] Yousif Zaid: I should start revising math cuz I completely forgot a lot of stuff and I don’t wanna be lost when we get back
[11/08/2025, 21.17.44] Yousif Zaid: I've decided to learn some easy songs on the guitar so i feel like i've achieved something
[11/08/2025, 21.21.39] Ems : Just like his brother
[11/08/2025, 21.21.58] Ems : I think I'm going to either do some biology or physics right now
[11/08/2025, 21.22.19] Yousif Zaid: its like how you said "me and marta are morphing into one person" but its the shitty version
[11/08/2025, 21.26.37] Ems : I don't know Marta and I are both annoying so I wouldn't say that
[11/08/2025, 21.27.40] Yousif Zaid: there's annoying and there's ayman
[11/08/2025, 21.28.10] Yousif Zaid: done. that was easy. being a pop star is easy
[11/08/2025, 21.30.09] Ems : I'm really glad your ego is under check
[11/08/2025, 21.30.13] Ems : What song was it
[11/08/2025, 21.30.42] Yousif Zaid: one is a suprise but i can tell you the other one is fade into you
[11/08/2025, 21.31.36] Yousif Zaid: its easy in the same way rhyming in italian is easy. every word ends with the same two vowels
[11/08/2025, 21.31.48] Ems : You know I'm really curious so this is hard
[11/08/2025, 21.31.58] Ems : But fade into you is amazing
[11/08/2025, 21.32.06] Ems : Ok I can guess it now I think
[11/08/2025, 21.32.12] Yousif Zaid: its literally just like. 3 chords
[11/08/2025, 21.32.18] Yousif Zaid: some of the first chords you learn on the guitar
[11/08/2025, 21.32.23] Ems : Yeah but it's pretty
[11/08/2025, 21.32.26] Yousif Zaid: i guess mazzy stars singing is what makes it
[11/08/2025, 21.32.31] Yousif Zaid: and i cannot do THAT
[11/08/2025, 21.32.47] Yousif Zaid: go on then
[11/08/2025, 21.32.54] Ems : You're too shy about your singing
[11/08/2025, 21.32.57] Ems : Bashful even
[11/08/2025, 21.33.09] Ems : Well now I think I got it wrong
[11/08/2025, 21.33.11] Yousif Zaid: i'm not shy about it i've been torturing my family with it for years
[11/08/2025, 21.33.28] Yousif Zaid: now you're being bashful
[11/08/2025, 21.33.55] Ems : I don't want to give a wrong answer
[11/08/2025, 21.34.01] Yousif Zaid: thats no way to live life
[11/08/2025, 21.34.21] Ems : I was thinking Coraline but now I think it's wrong
[11/08/2025, 21.34.23] Ems : I know so
[11/08/2025, 21.34.31] Yousif Zaid: actually that could be cool too
[11/08/2025, 21.34.39] Ems : It is if you want to be right
[11/08/2025, 21.34.49] Yousif Zaid: i'm always wrong and things go okay for me
[11/08/2025, 21.35.10] Yousif Zaid: oh its a bit harder than the two i just learned
[11/08/2025, 21.35.22] Ems : The riff definitely is
[11/08/2025, 21.35.28] Yousif Zaid: a *bit*
[11/08/2025, 21.35.29] Yousif Zaid: hold on
[11/08/2025, 21.36.08] Yousif Zaid: ah this could be learned with maybe like 3 hours focus
[11/08/2025, 21.37.23] Yousif Zaid: another day, i'll do some math
[11/08/2025, 21.40.59] Ems : I'll get on biology
[11/08/2025, 23.02.30] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[12/08/2025, 06.03.23] Ems : Do you like it? I really love this song
[12/08/2025, 08.04.42] Yousif Zaid: Of course I like it I didn’t text you to tell you I felt it was unbelievably bad ahahahha
[12/08/2025, 09.45.16] Ems : Ok still it is a beautiful song
[12/08/2025, 09.45.24] Ems : I thought you didn't like her
[12/08/2025, 09.45.54] Yousif Zaid: It really is
[12/08/2025, 09.46.03] Yousif Zaid: Generally I don’t but every artist has some songs that are good
[12/08/2025, 09.46.30] Yousif Zaid: Stuff like “bad guy” doesn’t appeal to me
[12/08/2025, 09.46.58] Ems : Yeah that's really really bad
[12/08/2025, 09.46.59] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[12/08/2025, 09.47.00] Ems : I agree
[12/08/2025, 09.47.14] Ems : Hahahahahahahaha
[12/08/2025, 09.47.27] Ems : Yousif what is this
[12/08/2025, 09.47.32] Ems : Nicotine pills
[12/08/2025, 09.47.34] Ems : No way
[12/08/2025, 09.47.37] Yousif Zaid: Chewing gum
[12/08/2025, 09.47.42] Yousif Zaid: Pills? Are you out of your mind
[12/08/2025, 09.47.52] Ems : Somehow it's not much better
[12/08/2025, 09.48.09] Yousif Zaid: Listen I have a pack of American cigarettes I intend for us to share in Rome and this is how I don’t rip them open like a feral dog
[12/08/2025, 09.48.18] Ems : Ohhh also I saw berry flavoured snus yesterday
[12/08/2025, 09.48.24] Ems : Ohhh I'm excited
[12/08/2025, 09.48.28] Ems : And mango?
[12/08/2025, 09.48.38] Yousif Zaid: We gotta try that shit out no??
[12/08/2025, 09.48.48] Ems : Of course
[12/08/2025, 09.48.58] Ems : I'm not taking snus without you though
[12/08/2025, 09.49.06] Yousif Zaid: Feels a bit bummy doesn’t it
[12/08/2025, 09.49.34] Yousif Zaid: My dad bought them to help him quit and now we have a stash
[12/08/2025, 09.50.05] Yousif Zaid: Last night I just walked up to him and said I was going crazy and needed some
[12/08/2025, 09.50.57] Ems : It's fair enough he did give you the whore cigs
[12/08/2025, 09.51.02] Yousif Zaid: I feel like I’m corrupting the youth
[12/08/2025, 09.51.11] Ems : I've never seen someone take them in public in Italy
[12/08/2025, 09.51.28] Ems : "the youth" is almost 20 at this point
[12/08/2025, 09.51.44] Yousif Zaid: I’m texting a 19 year old
[12/08/2025, 09.51.46] Ems : I'm going to start getting white hair in a month
[12/08/2025, 09.51.51] Ems : Fuck off
[12/08/2025, 09.52.16] Ems : I already feel more wise with age
[12/08/2025, 09.52.24] Yousif Zaid: I do have white hairs
[12/08/2025, 09.52.34] Yousif Zaid: And some ginger beard hairs on my chin somehow
[12/08/2025, 09.52.43] Yousif Zaid: God help us
[12/08/2025, 09.53.08] Ems : Were they always there?
[12/08/2025, 09.53.17] Yousif Zaid: Yeah? I also have a bald spot on my moustache
[12/08/2025, 09.53.24] Ems : Truly I don't know what bullshit I'll come up with
[12/08/2025, 09.53.37] Ems : Hahahahahahhaha i never noticed
[12/08/2025, 09.53.55] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[12/08/2025, 09.54.39] Ems : You can't call that a bald spot
[12/08/2025, 09.54.47] Yousif Zaid: There’s literally a gap
[12/08/2025, 09.54.56] Yousif Zaid: If this was on Soheyl’s hairline I’d laugh at him
[12/08/2025, 09.55.27] Yousif Zaid: My moms birthday is today we’re going to an Italian restaurant
[12/08/2025, 09.55.48] Yousif Zaid: No offense but after living with an Italian for an extended period of time going to an Italian restaurant seems a bit eh to me
[12/08/2025, 09.56.04] Ems : You'd laugh at him anyway
[12/08/2025, 09.56.34] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[12/08/2025, 09.56.35] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[12/08/2025, 09.57.02] Ems : At least you can judge the people who do unitalian stuff
[12/08/2025, 09.57.06] Ems : Like Claudio does
[12/08/2025, 09.57.19] Ems : Hahahahahahahahaha
[12/08/2025, 09.57.53] Yousif Zaid: I’m so tired of that man
[12/08/2025, 09.58.09] Yousif Zaid: One thing I like about you is you’re not a fascist
[12/08/2025, 09.59.08] Ems : I think I mess more with Italian cuisine than anyone else
[12/08/2025, 09.59.21] Ems : I draw the line at ketchup on pasta though
[12/08/2025, 09.59.27] Yousif Zaid: That’s gross
[12/08/2025, 09.59.39] Ems : Exactly
[12/08/2025, 09.59.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m kind of the same with Arab food?
[12/08/2025, 10.00.02] Yousif Zaid: Like I don’t mind it when white folks put pesto and shit In their hummus as long as it’s good
[12/08/2025, 10.00.12] Yousif Zaid: We have Arabs shitting themselves over it
[12/08/2025, 10.01.10] Ems : I get pesto, but what do they think about caramelized onions on hummus?
[12/08/2025, 10.01.20] Ems : Cause I personally love that
[12/08/2025, 10.02.49] Yousif Zaid: That sounds great
[12/08/2025, 10.02.56] Yousif Zaid: I’m willing to try anything once
[12/08/2025, 10.03.23] Yousif Zaid: We have this dish where we put ground beef and toasted almonds on hummus so I don’t see why we can’t also do onion
[12/08/2025, 10.05.44] Yousif Zaid: This reminds me that in Iraq we have this classic joke where an Iraqi man is like “I married a thin foreign (European) woman and my mom fed her (any greasy Iraqi food) and she died”
[12/08/2025, 10.06.53] Yousif Zaid: It’s much less funny when you translate it
[12/08/2025, 10.22.40] Ems : I read this in Claudio's voice

[12/08/2025, 10.29.07] Yousif Zaid: I wanted to take some initiative in the lab and do some procedure alone but it turns out I need to use something called “formic acid” and it’ll straight up kill me if I fuck up so I’m going to leave and go back to coding like a good boy

[12/08/2025, 16.38.26] Yousif Zaid: He tries having sex with woman dogs that are literally 10 times his size. He has the heart of a lion
[12/08/2025, 16.38.34] Ems : He's literally too cute to be smart
If he were smarter he would be less cute
[12/08/2025, 16.38.41] Ems : Hahahahahahah

[12/08/2025, 16.40.51] Yousif Zaid: She’s not pretty ? [12/08/2025, 16.41.04] Ems : When the family was coming over two weeks ago (the 9 pm ones) I bought some nice cheese, Ella slid into the kitchen and ate the whole thing
[12/08/2025, 16.41.14] Ems : She did the same thing on multiple occasions
[12/08/2025, 16.41.18] Yousif Zaid: I haven’t gotten a good look at her yet, you say she looks rat like
[12/08/2025, 16.41.18] Ems : Maybe we're dumb
[12/08/2025, 16.41.31] Ems : There's varying opinions
[12/08/2025, 16.41.58] Ems : I find her very very pretty but kind of ugly?
[12/08/2025, 16.42.03] Yousif Zaid: If I ate an entire block of cheese meant for your family I think the last thing you’d call me is smart
[12/08/2025, 16.42.55] Ems : I think my family appreciates anyone who likes cheese
[12/08/2025, 16.42.59] Ems : They're obsessed
[12/08/2025, 16.43.21] Ems : Ella is just unbothered in general
[12/08/2025, 16.43.32] Ems : What did your mom say about the flowers?

[12/08/2025, 16.46.33] Yousif Zaid: You still need to help me with a little treat I can bring Marta by the way

[12/08/2025, 21.09.32] Yousif Zaid: Buy anything?
[12/08/2025, 21.10.29] Ems : Depends on how much patience you have, a good measure is about 5 seconds I think
[12/08/2025, 21.10.42] Ems : A pair of white trousers
[12/08/2025, 21.10.48] Ems : Comfortable ones
[12/08/2025, 21.11.03] Yousif Zaid: Once I bought white pants and my father said I looked like a bottle of milk
[12/08/2025, 21.11.13] Yousif Zaid: Do you look like a bottle of milk?
[12/08/2025, 21.11.13] Ems : I said trousers not pants

[12/08/2025, 21.11.45] Yousif Zaid: Lady you can either be a smartass or believe I was showing my new underwear to my father
[12/08/2025, 21.12.28] Yousif Zaid: Imagine if I just walked in every time you started an episode of game of thrones and stopped it after 5 seconds
[12/08/2025, 21.12.34] Yousif Zaid: Gotta be tough for Mickey
[12/08/2025, 21.12.43] Ems : I can do both this way, you said pants
[12/08/2025, 21.13.06] Yousif Zaid: Maybe you’ll stop being like this once you get wise and turn 20
[12/08/2025, 21.13.23] Ems : Yeah tough, but all he does is smell pee so it's fine
[12/08/2025, 21.13.30] Ems : [12/08/2025, 21.13.45] Yousif Zaid: Is that what he’s smelling ???
[12/08/2025, 21.13.54] Yousif Zaid: What a freak
[12/08/2025, 21.14.19] Ems : It is, what did you think it was
[12/08/2025, 21.14.30] Yousif Zaid: Idk I stop to sniff flowers sometimes
[12/08/2025, 21.14.42] Yousif Zaid: Or maybe tracking someone
[12/08/2025, 21.14.44] Ems : You said he humped multiple dogs you knew he was a freak
[12/08/2025, 21.14.54] Yousif Zaid: The freaky part of this was their size
[12/08/2025, 21.15.06] Yousif Zaid: I kind of admire it
[12/08/2025, 21.15.30] Ems : He has a lot of courage for a half chihuahua
[12/08/2025, 21.15.37] Yousif Zaid: Pomeranians are even smaller

[12/08/2025, 21.21.52] Yousif Zaid: I have to do this whenever any dog comes by and he tries to fight it
[12/08/2025, 21.22.07] Ems : You're flinging him around
[12/08/2025, 21.22.29] Yousif Zaid: I’ve never met a dumber creature
[12/08/2025, 21.22.49] Ems : I was going to say something mean

[12/08/2025, 21.23.32] Yousif Zaid: Is vedant stupid?
[12/08/2025, 21.23.41] Yousif Zaid: I just thought he was a creepy little liar
[12/08/2025, 21.23.49] Ems : Have you heard him talk

[12/08/2025, 21.41.52] Ems : Yeah they are, the thing had puppies so it started getting angry
[12/08/2025, 21.41.57] Ems : Claudio was being racist
[12/08/2025, 21.42.06] Ems : They're mainly in our town
[12/08/2025, 21.42.15] Yousif Zaid: Sending me a voice message out of breath saying you got chased by a pig is hilarious actually
[12/08/2025, 21.43.17] Ems : It was too funny not to commemorate
[12/08/2025, 21.43.38] Yousif Zaid: Did this shit just happen

[12/08/2025, 21.45.31] Ems : Really scared actually I still think it's quite funny
[12/08/2025, 21.45.35] Yousif Zaid: Emma do you know how angry I’m gonna be if you get gored to death by a pig
[12/08/2025, 21.46.05] Yousif Zaid: So she’s scared and surrounded by boars and you’re texting an Arab
[12/08/2025, 21.46.11] Yousif Zaid: [12/08/2025, 21.46.14] Yousif Zaid: God bless
[12/08/2025, 22.18.30] Ems : Ok I'm alive and well I got home
[12/08/2025, 22.18.46] Yousif Zaid: I got worried for a sec there
[12/08/2025, 22.19.17] Ems : Dying from a wild boar would be too embarrassing
[12/08/2025, 22.19.35] Yousif Zaid: You’re not wrong but also definitely something that could happen to me
[12/08/2025, 22.19.42] Yousif Zaid: If I don’t die of old age I know it’ll be embarrassing
[12/08/2025, 22.20.21] Ems : But a wild boar is above and beyond
[12/08/2025, 22.20.26] Ems : What the fuck
[12/08/2025, 22.20.32] Yousif Zaid: A vikings death
[12/08/2025, 22.20.38] Yousif Zaid: How close did they get to you
[12/08/2025, 22.20.40] Ems : One I couldn't even see i just heard it getting angry
[12/08/2025, 22.20.48] Yousif Zaid: How many were there what
[12/08/2025, 22.20.57] Ems : Too close
[12/08/2025, 22.21.23] Ems : One in front one with puppies behind that's why we were worried
[12/08/2025, 22.21.37] Ems : I wouldn't say puppies
[12/08/2025, 22.21.43] Yousif Zaid: Were the piglets cute at least
[12/08/2025, 22.21.44] Ems : Piglets maybe
[12/08/2025, 22.22.21] Ems : They usually are I didn't get a good look at them this time, the mother getting angry was distracting
[12/08/2025, 22.22.46] Yousif Zaid: Has Marta calmed down
[12/08/2025, 22.22.47] Ems : Also it was pitch black
[12/08/2025, 22.23.04] Ems : I'm sure she'll survive
[12/08/2025, 22.23.17] Yousif Zaid: My brother tries to act tough but he’s horrified of bees
[12/08/2025, 22.24.09] Ems : How scared? Like running and screaming?
[12/08/2025, 22.24.18] Yousif Zaid: Running not screaming
[12/08/2025, 22.24.50] Yousif Zaid: Like I think he’d actually interrupt his own wedding ceremony to sprint away from his wife
[12/08/2025, 22.25.28] Ems : Wow I think that's a phobia
[12/08/2025, 22.25.55] Yousif Zaid: At least martas fear of wild boars is reasonable
[12/08/2025, 22.26.23] Ems : I've never seen them get so angry
[12/08/2025, 22.26.29] Ems : I think they didn't like us
[12/08/2025, 22.27.10] Yousif Zaid: I’m reminded of little Mickey and how pathetic he is
[12/08/2025, 22.27.13] Yousif Zaid: He’d try to fight them
[12/08/2025, 22.27.23] Ems : I think I need some sleep after this one
[12/08/2025, 22.27.29] Ems : Poor little guy
[12/08/2025, 22.27.36] Ems : He'd get butchered
[12/08/2025, 22.27.45] Yousif Zaid: For sure

[13/08/2025, 19.35.54] Yousif Zaid: So your bedtime is in 20 minutes I’m guessing?

[13/08/2025, 19.49.57] Yousif Zaid: Ayman is feeding the dog bruschetta
[13/08/2025, 21.20.58] Ems : Yeah yeah
[13/08/2025, 21.21.11] Ems : Wait what happened? Is everything ok?
[13/08/2025, 21.21.21] Ems : What a fancy dog Chili is
[13/08/2025, 21.21.41] Yousif Zaid: Chili is the one that peed everywhere this is Mickey
[13/08/2025, 21.21.50] Yousif Zaid: Mickeys grandpa (a human being) died
[13/08/2025, 21.21.58] Yousif Zaid: That’s why we’re taking care of the dog

[13/08/2025, 21.40.24] Ems : Oh I'm sorry
[13/08/2025, 21.40.50] Ems : You're right you told me, were you close with him?
[13/08/2025, 21.40.57] Yousif Zaid: For a sec I thought you was sorry about the dude that croaked but nah just getting mickeys name wrong
[13/08/2025, 21.41.00] Yousif Zaid: That’s very funny
[13/08/2025, 21.41.21] Ems : Is this a rabbit???
[13/08/2025, 21.41.31] Ems : To be fair I hadn't read the next text
[13/08/2025, 21.41.45] Yousif Zaid: Hedgehog I believe? Mickey was playing with him and I pulled him out so fast when I saw that the poor dog went flying
[13/08/2025, 21.41.56] Ems : I'm obviously more sorry about that than getting the dogs name wrong
[13/08/2025, 21.41.56] Yousif Zaid: Never even met the guy
[13/08/2025, 21.42.48] Ems : It is so cute
I feel like you make Mickey fly for no reason now, it's just fun to you
[13/08/2025, 21.43.14] Yousif Zaid: This time I had a reason I didn’t want the poor boy to get spikes on him
[13/08/2025, 21.43.25] Yousif Zaid: He weighs like 6 kg it’s too much fun
[13/08/2025, 21.43.51] Yousif Zaid: I took him on a two hour walk I forgot he’s an old man he’s so tired now
[13/08/2025, 21.43.59] Ems : A gray heron I know what this is now
[13/08/2025, 21.44.03] Ems : Hahahahahahahaj
[13/08/2025, 21.44.20] Ems : I miss walking I'm so jealous of you
[13/08/2025, 21.44.23] Ems : Actually
[13/08/2025, 21.44.36] Yousif Zaid: I’ll take you here at some point
[13/08/2025, 21.44.50] Yousif Zaid: Very nice forest, river that goes on for kilometers and kilometers
[13/08/2025, 21.45.05] Yousif Zaid: I think I’ve said this maybe 15 times over the summer at this point
[13/08/2025, 21.45.24] Ems : Yes please it sounds divine
[13/08/2025, 21.45.34] Ems : Lots of places to go to
[13/08/2025, 21.46.16] Yousif Zaid: Every time I say it I hope to myself I’m not holding you hostage by suggesting so many things, I always have that feeling somehow
[13/08/2025, 21.46.25] Ems : I think the only productive thing I did these few days was cut my hair
[13/08/2025, 21.46.35] Ems : Yes that's exactly the case
[13/08/2025, 21.46.38] Yousif Zaid: Would I be able to tell
[13/08/2025, 21.46.47] Ems : Why would you say that
[13/08/2025, 21.46.58] Ems : No I think I did a good job
[13/08/2025, 21.47.33] Yousif Zaid: No I trust that you choose to hang out with me I’m just thinking out loud, I do it with everybody, but I’ve gotten good at ignoring that feeling [13/08/2025, 21.49.16] Yousif Zaid: Let me see
[13/08/2025, 21.49.35] Ems : I think everyone thinks so, impostor syndrome and all
[13/08/2025, 21.49.44] Ems : I'll see if I have a picture
[13/08/2025, 21.50.40] Yousif Zaid: Probably. A 19 year old I went to high school with published a physics research paper with a Copenhagen university professor on a new theory of gravity that potentially disproves Einstein. I read it last night and felt a ton of impostor syndrome
[13/08/2025, 21.51.26] Yousif Zaid: He’s like an actual real life Sheldon cooper
[13/08/2025, 21.52.01] Ems : Oh wow, did you understand if it's correct?
[13/08/2025, 21.52.28] Ems : I do not have a picture, imagine the hair is what it looked like in may
[13/08/2025, 21.52.40] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/08/2025, 21.52.41] Ems : I'll send one tomorrow
[13/08/2025, 21.52.50] Yousif Zaid: This is the first sentence, what do you think?
[13/08/2025, 21.53.19] Yousif Zaid: It’s professor level work and the kid is 19 it makes me sick
[13/08/2025, 21.53.35] Ems : This is a 19 year old?
[13/08/2025, 21.53.39] Ems : I'm wasting my life
[13/08/2025, 21.53.43] Yousif Zaid: Emma it’s a real life Sheldon cooper
[13/08/2025, 21.54.01] Yousif Zaid: My only consolation is that he’s so violently depressed and nihilistic that he told me he can’t even love his own family
[13/08/2025, 21.54.18] Yousif Zaid: Like he can’t logically explain why he should love his mom so he doesn’t
[13/08/2025, 21.54.25] Ems : I feel bad for the guy and useless at the same time
[13/08/2025, 21.54.26] Yousif Zaid: So I’d rather be Yousif than be that guy
[13/08/2025, 21.54.48] Ems : Sheldon loves him mom
[13/08/2025, 21.55.03] Yousif Zaid: I had this whole discussion with him about why he should be happy and I straight up lost
[13/08/2025, 21.55.06] Yousif Zaid: It was super funny
[13/08/2025, 21.55.24] Yousif Zaid: Like I could not win an argument over why he shouldn’t be suicidal
[13/08/2025, 21.55.39] Yousif Zaid: At the end I just had to say “yeah man fine you win kill yourself if you want”
[13/08/2025, 21.56.10] Yousif Zaid: He started quoting philosophy texts at me to prove why life has no meaning
[13/08/2025, 21.57.03] Ems : The man has purpose if you think about it
[13/08/2025, 21.57.24] Ems : Being suicide and writing this is so cool of him
[13/08/2025, 21.57.29] Ems : Suicidal*
[13/08/2025, 21.57.33] Ems : Autocorrect
[13/08/2025, 21.57.35] Yousif Zaid: He would disagree with you and then quote 17th century philosophers and psychologists to prove you wrong
[13/08/2025, 21.58.13] Yousif Zaid: I even tried to get him with the “if I pointed a gun at you you’d beg for your life” and he was like “actually Nietzsche says this is not conscious behavior but animal instinct” or something
[13/08/2025, 21.58.31] Yousif Zaid: He’s incredibly cool and I have a lot of admiration for him
[13/08/2025, 21.59.44] Ems : I would love to argue with him
[13/08/2025, 22.00.13] Yousif Zaid: He’s an interesting guy for sure
[13/08/2025, 22.00.38] Yousif Zaid: Looking forward to it. Shouldn’t you be going to bed soon? It’s 10 pm
[13/08/2025, 22.01.31] Ems : Actually yes, I know you're making fun but it is bedtime
[13/08/2025, 22.01.51] Yousif Zaid: I’m literally not I just know you’re probably dozing off right about now
[13/08/2025, 22.02.30] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight then ems, I’ll stay up doing some studying probably
[13/08/2025, 22.03.10] Ems : Nice of you to be concerned, I am going to read and sleep
[13/08/2025, 22.03.19] Ems : Night yuyu
[13/08/2025, 22.03.27] Ems : You're doing a lot of studying
[13/08/2025, 22.03.31] Yousif Zaid: What are you reading?

[14/08/2025, 11.52.57] Yousif Zaid: You’ll never guess what I did this morning
[14/08/2025, 13.36.35] Ems : What on earth did you do
[14/08/2025, 13.59.57] Yousif Zaid: 20 more liters of milk
[14/08/2025, 14.00.17] Yousif Zaid: I was in a much better mood when I sent this text we just buried the guy
[14/08/2025, 14.12.19] Ems : I'm actually shocked I don't know what to say
[14/08/2025, 14.12.24] Ems : I'm sorry
[14/08/2025, 14.12.36] Yousif Zaid: I’ll text when I’m done driving
[14/08/2025, 14.12.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m ok I didn’t know the guy
[14/08/2025, 14.13.09] Ems : Yeah but it's never fun to go to a funeral
[14/08/2025, 14.13.20] Yousif Zaid: I’ll tell you in 15
[14/08/2025, 14.30.42] Yousif Zaid: Yeah the thing that bothered me mostly was all the women and grandmas reactions to the whole thing
[14/08/2025, 14.31.02] Yousif Zaid: Then something unexpected happened that Arabs apparently do (I’ve never been to a funeral before), I helped bury the guy myself
[14/08/2025, 14.31.51] Yousif Zaid: I was shovelling dirt into the hole and all the women dressed in black crowded around me and stuff, it all felt very strange
[14/08/2025, 14.35.45] Yousif Zaid: The guys 5 year old grandson asked me to put some dirt onto a shovel so he could throw it in the hole and that was a bummer [14/08/2025, 15.43.30] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[14/08/2025, 15.49.12] Ems : I'm so sorry this sounds very very hard
[14/08/2025, 15.49.14] Ems : Truly
[14/08/2025, 15.49.30] Ems : Sorry I didn't see I fully slept
[14/08/2025, 15.49.37] Ems : That's the spirit
[14/08/2025, 15.49.47] Yousif Zaid: I hope I don’t sound like a psycho but I am doing pretty good don’t worry
[14/08/2025, 15.49.59] Yousif Zaid: Now I can say I buried a guy
[14/08/2025, 15.50.01] Ems : You've got the birthday today no? Or was that yesterday?
[14/08/2025, 15.50.09] Yousif Zaid: On my way there now

[15/08/2025, 19.31.26] Yousif Zaid: I ordered cookies and cream and felt like a child when Louis went after me and asked for pistachio and lemon
[15/08/2025, 20.09.51] Ems : I'm actually forcing you to order pistachio in italy
[15/08/2025, 20.19.54] Yousif Zaid: I do love pistachio
[15/08/2025, 20.21.25] Yousif Zaid: I was just in the mood for some Oreo
[15/08/2025, 20.43.29] Yousif Zaid: I don’t want you to think that I’m nagging you but a little something for Marta is the only thing left on my to-do list, any ideas or can I just improvise?
[15/08/2025, 21.43.18] Ems : This is really sweet of you, you know you don't need to bring anything But what I think she would like most is if you find some Fanta raspberry or faxe kondi zero at the airport, because she loves soft drinks
[15/08/2025, 21.44.19] Ems : Otherwise just anything you think I'm sure she'll love
[15/08/2025, 21.44.29] Yousif Zaid: Okay, maybe faxe kondi zero would be good, it’s more “danish”
[15/08/2025, 21.45.33] Ems : Yeah definitely, we don't have lots of soft drinks here
[15/08/2025, 21.45.41] Yousif Zaid: It’s nothing really, I just want to make an impression and honestly my parents would be mad if I didn’t, it’s very rude not to in Iraq
[15/08/2025, 21.46.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/08/2025, 21.47.47] Yousif Zaid: The helium balloon shaped like a pair of lips is ridiculous
[15/08/2025, 22.06.35] Ems : Honestly you know you don't have to worry
[15/08/2025, 22.06.58] Yousif Zaid: I know, It’s more for me at this point
[15/08/2025, 22.07.18] Ems : It definitely gives a party impression
[15/08/2025, 22.07.23] Yousif Zaid: Also who is patsy?
[15/08/2025, 22.07.22] Ems : It's quite funny
[15/08/2025, 22.07.46] Ems : I'm so confused how do you know?
[15/08/2025, 22.07.52] Ems : It's my grandma's name
[15/08/2025, 22.07.57] Ems : Full name is Patricia
[15/08/2025, 22.07.59] Yousif Zaid: Instagram keeps telling me to follow a patsy
[15/08/2025, 22.08.06] Ems : HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAH
[15/08/2025, 22.08.09] Ems : Okok
[15/08/2025, 22.08.21] Yousif Zaid: So that’s grandma then, okay
[15/08/2025, 22.08.34] Yousif Zaid: “You might know patsy!”
[15/08/2025, 22.08.54] Yousif Zaid: Uhhhhhh okay? I click on the profile, picture of you and your sister
[15/08/2025, 22.09.29] Yousif Zaid: Her outfit in that one post is cool as hell
[15/08/2025, 22.17.39] Ems : Yeah it's from my 18th birthday hahahahah
[15/08/2025, 22.17.52] Ems : She's an icon I swear
[15/08/2025, 22.17.55] Yousif Zaid: Is it awful to ask if this is the one that’s still here with us
[15/08/2025, 22.18.01] Ems : She is
[15/08/2025, 22.18.27] Yousif Zaid: I was afraid to hit follow
[15/08/2025, 22.18.42] Yousif Zaid: I still think I won’t, for now at least maybe we become best friends who knows
[15/08/2025, 22.19.15] Yousif Zaid: Moulden as a surname this is the English one?
[15/08/2025, 22.21.12] Ems : Yes
[15/08/2025, 22.29.15] Ems : Ok I managed to get away from the table earlier today
[15/08/2025, 22.29.25] Ems : I'm absolutely shattered
[15/08/2025, 22.29.29] Yousif Zaid: I’m happy for you
[15/08/2025, 22.29.36] Yousif Zaid: Tired from eating dinner
[15/08/2025, 22.29.47] Ems : It's exhausting
[15/08/2025, 22.30.00] Yousif Zaid: What was the food? Was it nice at least?
[15/08/2025, 22.30.12] Yousif Zaid: Is it exhausting because you’re sitting down and talking for like 3 hours?
[15/08/2025, 22.30.56] Ems : No I was joking the exhausting part was how much I walked and swam today
[15/08/2025, 22.31.18] Yousif Zaid: I would have totally believed you were tired from Italian style dinner
[15/08/2025, 22.31.30] Ems : Actually really nice
We had leftover barbecue meat, lemon meatballs, cheeses and stuff
[15/08/2025, 22.32.26] Ems : It's less exhausting than with other people because we just put stuff in the middle instead of doing like first second and third course
[15/08/2025, 22.32.34] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[15/08/2025, 22.33.06] Ems : It looks so good truly
[15/08/2025, 22.33.08] Yousif Zaid: That sounds like a much better time, it’s how we do things here
[15/08/2025, 22.33.14] Ems : Also leftovers always taste better?
[15/08/2025, 22.33.24] Yousif Zaid: Imagine a birthday cake but it’s rice and stuff
[15/08/2025, 22.33.37] Yousif Zaid: I might force my mom to make one for my actual birthday
[15/08/2025, 22.33.49] Yousif Zaid: They do
[15/08/2025, 22.34.07] Yousif Zaid: Did you just get up and say “guys I can’t do this anymore”
[15/08/2025, 22.34.08] Ems : Yes do that
[15/08/2025, 22.34.29] Ems : I was like "I need to pack I might be back"
[15/08/2025, 22.34.35] Ems : I'm not going back
[15/08/2025, 22.34.42] Yousif Zaid: Ahahhahahahahahha
[15/08/2025, 22.35.06] Yousif Zaid: If I ever hear you say “I might be back” at any point after 8 pm I’m gonna accept that that’s all I’ll see of emma that day
[15/08/2025, 22.35.11] Ems : So I'll go sleep because there's no way
[15/08/2025, 22.35.33] Yousif Zaid: Case in point
[15/08/2025, 22.35.32] Ems : Exactly, this is absolutely correct
[15/08/2025, 22.35.51] Yousif Zaid: This is a very thinly veiled “you got me fucked up”
[15/08/2025, 22.36.04] Yousif Zaid: You can’t say “you got me fucked up” to your family
[15/08/2025, 22.36.16] Yousif Zaid: Life is about trying to say it without saying it
[15/08/2025, 22.37.13] Ems : It really is
[15/08/2025, 22.37.28] Ems : Goodnight, I'll have the best sleep ever
[15/08/2025, 22.37.44] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight ems, dream of the Boone
[15/08/2025, 22.38.49] Ems : This sounds like a threat
[15/08/2025, 22.38.56] Ems : Night yuyu
[16/08/2025, 07.51.49] Ems : image omitted
[16/08/2025, 07.52.27] Ems : Unfortunately I don't think I can't lend this to you except if you learn Italian very very quickly
[16/08/2025, 08.20.24] Yousif Zaid: The road! I’ve been wanting to read it for a while
[16/08/2025, 08.21.39] Yousif Zaid: It’s supposed to be like, post apocalyptic
[16/08/2025, 08.24.35] Yousif Zaid: I’m not so talented but I’ve been practicing important words to overhear for when I visit
[16/08/2025, 08.25.23] Yousif Zaid: “handsome”, “funny”, that kind of thing
[16/08/2025, 08.47.32] Ems : I'm so excited to read it it was really nice of him to lend it
[16/08/2025, 08.47.40] Ems : Of course of course
[16/08/2025, 08.48.03] Ems : Go on what are they in Italian
[16/08/2025, 09.08.04] Yousif Zaid: Bello and divertente are two that I expect to hear when I’m down there
[16/08/2025, 09.08.17] Yousif Zaid: ritardato as well
[16/08/2025, 09.10.43] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted
[16/08/2025, 09.13.02] Yousif Zaid: Carino
[16/08/2025, 09.13.13] Yousif Zaid: Basically I’m up to no good
[16/08/2025, 10.04.38] Ems : Ok you're all set and ready to go
[16/08/2025, 10.04.41] Ems : Hahahahahahahahah
[16/08/2025, 10.05.05] Ems : Just don't say the feet line
[16/08/2025, 10.05.07] Yousif Zaid: This is how we make it
[16/08/2025, 10.05.13] Ems : I don't even remember what it was
[16/08/2025, 10.05.20] Yousif Zaid: I remember it in English
[16/08/2025, 10.05.32] Ems : Oh yeah Claudio had translated it
[16/08/2025, 10.05.36] Ems : It was horrid
[16/08/2025, 10.05.44] Yousif Zaid: It’s basically an old timey chivalrous marriage proposal
[16/08/2025, 10.05.50] Yousif Zaid: Except the last 3 words are changed
[16/08/2025, 10.06.10] Yousif Zaid: And the change makes all the difference
[16/08/2025, 10.06.27] Ems : I remember most of it now
[16/08/2025, 10.06.33] Ems : It was funny
[16/08/2025, 10.06.44] Yousif Zaid: Funny enough to work? I’m not gonna find out
[16/08/2025, 10.06.50] Ems : So are you spending the first night at Claudio's place?
[16/08/2025, 10.07.07] Ems : You could investigate for scientific purposes
[16/08/2025, 10.07.31] Yousif Zaid: I feel like an Arab doing that in Italy would perhaps get me lynched
[16/08/2025, 10.07.34] Ems : If I could see that I would die laughing
[16/08/2025, 10.07.48] Yousif Zaid: 3 drinks is all it would take I’m afraid
[16/08/2025, 10.08.32] Ems : You think too highly of your tolerance Two strong beers and it's done
[16/08/2025, 10.08.36] Yousif Zaid: Yes, first day we explore Bologna, then go to the Pagani factory
[16/08/2025, 10.08.48] Yousif Zaid: Afterwards we go to Forli
[16/08/2025, 10.09.26] Yousif Zaid: On a scale of 1-10, 1 being “oh this is just a socially awkward thing to say”, and 10 being “I’m gonna get into a bar fight” how bad of an idea is it
[16/08/2025, 10.11.17] Ems : I'd say it's a 4, I think if you have a few Italian speaking people with you you'd be just fine
[16/08/2025, 10.11.26] Ems : Actually make that a 6
[16/08/2025, 10.14.19] Yousif Zaid: I think it depends how racist the victim is
[16/08/2025, 10.14.27] Yousif Zaid: I’m calling her a victim in this scenario, naturally
[16/08/2025, 10.24.29] Ems : Yeah maybe
[16/08/2025, 10.24.48] Ems : Pray it's not a Giorgia Meloni fan then
[16/08/2025, 10.25.06] Ems : I might have the police looking at my phone after this one
[16/08/2025, 10.32.47] Yousif Zaid: Right cuz I feel like we’re forgetting how creepy it is just because it also happens to be funny
[16/08/2025, 10.35.17] Yousif Zaid: I should probably get my hair cut a little bit
[16/08/2025, 10.41.58] Yousif Zaid: I look like a cave bear
[16/08/2025, 11.17.15] Ems : I think the general rule is don't cut your hair in summer
[16/08/2025, 11.17.49] Yousif Zaid: Even if you look like you eat raw salmon and berries exclusively?
[16/08/2025, 11.29.30] Ems : The pictures you sent the other day were nice I don't see the bear effect
[16/08/2025, 11.29.39] Ems : Are you sure you're not being dramatic?
[16/08/2025, 11.29.52] Yousif Zaid: My parents saw my bed head and called me a bear
[16/08/2025, 11.30.11] Yousif Zaid: And my mom said I should get a haircut
[16/08/2025, 11.31.09] Ems : I think it can probably wait but I don't know how dramatic the situation is
[16/08/2025, 11.31.34] Yousif Zaid: Well my mom would prefer if I just had a buzz cut 24/7
[16/08/2025, 11.31.51] Yousif Zaid: I’ll definitely do my beard up though that’s actually problematic
[16/08/2025, 11.31.56] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/08/2025, 11.41.09] Ems : Where are you now?
[16/08/2025, 11.41.22] Ems : You're always in a park
[16/08/2025, 11.41.34] Yousif Zaid: This is from yesterday we did a silly perspective thingy
[16/08/2025, 11.41.45] Yousif Zaid: Look at the trees and u can see how steep it is
[16/08/2025, 11.42.02] Yousif Zaid: Does our schedule in Rome allow for a walk?
[16/08/2025, 11.43.07] Ems : Ohh that's true it's cool
[16/08/2025, 11.43.21] Ems : Yes I think so
[16/08/2025, 11.43.30] Yousif Zaid: I can wake up early once with you if we have to
[16/08/2025, 11.43.36] Ems : There's some beautiful parks in the city
[16/08/2025, 11.44.05] Ems : This is the nicest thing, I know how much you hate waking up early
[16/08/2025, 11.44.18] Yousif Zaid: When in Rome
[16/08/2025, 11.44.31] Ems : If you're lucky you can even spot some wild boars!!
[16/08/2025, 11.44.53] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna try to wrestle one and just die in front of you
[16/08/2025, 11.44.57] Yousif Zaid: Fuck up everyone’s holiday
[16/08/2025, 11.45.16] Ems : That would be a bummer to a nice trip
[16/08/2025, 11.45.19] Ems : Let's not
[16/08/2025, 11.45.40] Yousif Zaid: I googled it and apparently you’re just supposed to step to the side at the last second
[16/08/2025, 11.45.43] Yousif Zaid: Like a matador
[16/08/2025, 11.46.32] Ems : By the way, I know you said it's up to me but if you have any requests let me know I'll make it work. Both for things to do and food
[16/08/2025, 11.46.36] Yousif Zaid: Feel free to wake me whenever, we have too little time to worry about me getting my beauty sleep
[16/08/2025, 11.46.56] Ems : That's going to be helpful in my next near death experience
[16/08/2025, 11.47.09] Yousif Zaid: Literally the only thing I know about Rome is that you have a colloseum there, and I don’t even care about the colloseum so much
[16/08/2025, 11.47.21] Yousif Zaid: I’ve recently discovered that I fucking love arancini
[16/08/2025, 11.47.51] Ems : Well that's Sicily
In Rome there's a similar thing called suppli
[16/08/2025, 11.47.54] Ems : Which is better
[16/08/2025, 11.48.13] Yousif Zaid: Then I would like to go to a restaurant where we can order suppli
[16/08/2025, 11.48.26] Yousif Zaid: Or you let me try make them in your kitchen
[16/08/2025, 11.48.26] Ems : I'm not queuing two hours in the sun to see some rocks, but we'll definitely see it from outside
[16/08/2025, 11.48.44] Yousif Zaid: I knew I was right not to care so much
[16/08/2025, 11.49.23] Ems : Deal
[16/08/2025, 11.49.37] Yousif Zaid: You know I haven’t spoken to Claudio in like 8 days, and I’m wondering if he’ll even pick me up at the airport if I don’t remind him
[16/08/2025, 11.50.03] Ems : Is that man ok?
[16/08/2025, 11.50.10] Ems : You're going on a trip together
[16/08/2025, 11.50.13] Ems : Text each other
[16/08/2025, 11.50.15] Yousif Zaid: He’s on some Croatian island?
[16/08/2025, 11.50.23] Yousif Zaid: With his scouts? I’m sure he’s doing great
[16/08/2025, 11.50.26] Ems : Wait the game of thrones one?
[16/08/2025, 11.50.31] Ems : Ah nevermind
[16/08/2025, 11.50.44] Yousif Zaid: You saw scouts and stopped being excited or what
[16/08/2025, 11.50.51] Yousif Zaid: I’ll text him now
[16/08/2025, 11.51.30] Yousif Zaid: Idk I call him and he’s like “tell me”
[16/08/2025, 11.51.31] Ems : It's so funny every time I'm reminded he's a boy scout
[16/08/2025, 11.51.48] Yousif Zaid: Like damn what if I wanna twirl my hair and play in bed kicking my feet and chitchat
[16/08/2025, 11.52.25] Yousif Zaid: I only say add the “boy” in the beginning when I want to make fun of him
[16/08/2025, 11.56.13] Ems : How rude of him
[16/08/2025, 11.56.36] Ems : It works it's funny
[16/08/2025, 11.56.49] Yousif Zaid: “You fuckin Boy Scout”
[16/08/2025, 11.56.54] Yousif Zaid: Immediately makes me giggle
[16/08/2025, 13.16.13] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/08/2025, 13.16.13] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[16/08/2025, 13.50.14] Ems : He's worse than me
[16/08/2025, 13.50.38] Ems : Are you in the place near dtu? I'm sure you aren't but it looks like it
[16/08/2025, 13.59.41] Yousif Zaid: River near my parents house
[16/08/2025, 14.00.01] Yousif Zaid: Mickey is an old man I just had to cradle him in my arms and carry him because he gets tired from my long walks
[16/08/2025, 14.00.50] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[16/08/2025, 14.02.06] Yousif Zaid: He fell asleep while I was carrying him the dumbass
[16/08/2025, 16.15.29] Ems : I think it might be hard to let go of him when you have to give him back
[16/08/2025, 16.15.37] Ems : Such a little baby
[16/08/2025, 16.25.39] Yousif Zaid: I fully see him as my son at this point and will fist fight his owner before giving him back
[16/08/2025, 16.26.34] Yousif Zaid: He’s so stupid and cute it makes my chest hurt sometimes
[16/08/2025, 16.33.08] Ems : What day is your plane? You might have to say goodbye to him then
[16/08/2025, 16.33.14] Ems : It's not going to be easy
[16/08/2025, 16.33.30] Yousif Zaid: Owner is picking him up tommorow and I leave on Monday
[16/08/2025, 16.33.42] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been practicing my right hook
[16/08/2025, 16.33.47] Ems : Did you manage to check what day the last exam is? Marta is asking about her birthday
[16/08/2025, 16.33.55] Ems : You're going to cry
[16/08/2025, 16.33.59] Ems : I just know it
[16/08/2025, 16.34.07] Yousif Zaid: He’s old man :(
[16/08/2025, 16.37.46] Ems : He fell asleep in your arms
[16/08/2025, 16.37.46] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/08/2025, 16.37.51] Ems : It's going to be tragic
[16/08/2025, 16.38.07] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[16/08/2025, 16.38.20] Yousif Zaid: I'm sorry but it looks like its on the 22nd of december
[16/08/2025, 16.38.25] Yousif Zaid: martas birthday was the 18th right?
[16/08/2025, 16.38.40] Ems : 20th
[16/08/2025, 16.38.45] Ems : Thanks for looking
[16/08/2025, 16.39.04] Yousif Zaid: your family can always just like
[16/08/2025, 16.39.09] Yousif Zaid: take 2 days off
[16/08/2025, 16.39.28] Yousif Zaid: delay the celebration by 48 hours. not the worst thing in the world
[16/08/2025, 16.50.03] Yousif Zaid: Still sad, sorry
[16/08/2025, 17.07.10] Ems : Yeah it's fine I checked and I thought it was this I was hoping I was wrong
[16/08/2025, 17.07.18] Ems : We'll survive I'm sure

[16/08/2025, 18.48.23] Yousif Zaid: I’m walking over to Louie’s apartment to have dinner with him and his family. He’s off to boarding school until January so I’m spending as much time with him as possible [16/08/2025, 20.05.22] Ems : It's kind of cool, I approve
[16/08/2025, 20.05.50] Ems : That's actually really sad I know how much you like spending time with him
[17/08/2025, 00.45.38] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 00.45.38] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 00.46.08] Yousif Zaid: My dads wallpaper is us at high school prom. We weren’t each others dates if that’s what you’re thinking
[17/08/2025, 00.46.42] Yousif Zaid: Yeah I’m gonna miss him a lot. I hope he can at least find a wife or something at this boarding school
[17/08/2025, 11.40.52] Ems : I think he has plenty of time
[17/08/2025, 11.42.17] Yousif Zaid: These young adult boarding schools are a Danish marriage market I suspect
[17/08/2025, 11.43.57] Ems : Lots of young danish girls with no parents you're right
[17/08/2025, 11.44.34] Ems : Are you flying today?
[17/08/2025, 11.45.32] Yousif Zaid: Tommorow morning at 9
[17/08/2025, 11.46.01] Yousif Zaid: Big day today, have a fuck ton of stuff to prepare and also will go out with the guys
[17/08/2025, 12.06.56] Ems : How many bags have you decided to bring? Or how much will Claudio let you
[17/08/2025, 12.07.08] Ems : I've decided to finish my book today
[17/08/2025, 12.12.34] Yousif Zaid: The ticket comes with a backpack and a 10 kg carry on small suitcase
[17/08/2025, 12.12.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m not being a sycophant when I say this but
[17/08/2025, 12.13.22] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 12.13.29] Yousif Zaid: That is also on my list for today
[17/08/2025, 12.32.23] Ems : How much you got left? I have around 80 pages I think
[17/08/2025, 12.34.22] Yousif Zaid: Mine is a short story I have 30 pages left
[17/08/2025, 12.34.31] Yousif Zaid: It’s a difficult 30 pages though, my IQ isn’t so high
[17/08/2025, 12.41.45] Ems : No for some books 10 pages feel like 50
[17/08/2025, 12.42.09] Ems : Did you check the first one
[17/08/2025, 12.42.30] Yousif Zaid: Not yet, I think I’ll buy a fuckton of faxe kondi from the terminal
[17/08/2025, 12.42.41] Yousif Zaid: They won’t let me bring beverages through security
[17/08/2025, 12.43.20] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAH
[17/08/2025, 12.43.38] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna walk out the fucking plane with an armful of soda
[17/08/2025, 12.43.45] Ems : It's a shame you're not flying from here, they now let you bring up to 2L through security
[17/08/2025, 12.44.04] Yousif Zaid: They don’t even sell the 2 liter bottles at the airport I have to show up with an armful of 0.5 bottles
[17/08/2025, 12.44.20] Ems : Honestly she'll appreciate just one don't worry
[17/08/2025, 12.44.30] Ems : Nono I mean in general
[17/08/2025, 12.44.41] Ems : Just think of everything you could potentially bring back
[17/08/2025, 12.44.56] Yousif Zaid: Just one feels like I’m getting her a drink at the dtu cafeteria come on now
[17/08/2025, 12.45.22] Yousif Zaid: Claudio told me to “meet him at the Lamborghini” when I land
[17/08/2025, 12.45.32] Yousif Zaid: Whatever the fuck that means
[17/08/2025, 12.45.41] Ems : She'll learn to appreciate what she has
[17/08/2025, 12.45.46] Ems : Oh god
[17/08/2025, 12.45.59] Yousif Zaid: Knowing him I think he’s being literal
[17/08/2025, 12.46.17] Yousif Zaid: This isn’t a metaphor I think there’s an actual Lamborghini outside the airport that I’m supposed to go to
[17/08/2025, 12.53.14] Ems : One hundred percent
[17/08/2025, 12.53.23] Ems : I really have no doubts
[17/08/2025, 12.54.58] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna send you a picture that might be weird at first but the point is that I think I’m being pranked by mosquitos
[17/08/2025, 12.56.19] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 12.56.24] Yousif Zaid: What the fuck is this
[17/08/2025, 12.57.00] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
[17/08/2025, 12.57.10] Ems : They really made a row there
[17/08/2025, 12.57.16] Ems : Very precise of them
[17/08/2025, 12.57.25] Yousif Zaid: It’s so difficult to itch I’m going crazy
[17/08/2025, 12.57.34] Yousif Zaid: Are there lots of mosquitos in Italy
[17/08/2025, 12.57.54] Ems : Do NOT scratch get them they have gels that make them not itchy
[17/08/2025, 12.58.02] Ems : Go to the farmacy
[17/08/2025, 12.58.14] Ems : Yes get spray and bite relief
[17/08/2025, 12.58.14] Yousif Zaid: The what
[17/08/2025, 12.58.27] Yousif Zaid: The farmacy
[17/08/2025, 12.58.41] Ems : Yes
[17/08/2025, 12.58.51] Ems : Oh
[17/08/2025, 12.58.53] Yousif Zaid: I can’t fucking reach anyway
[17/08/2025, 12.59.00] Ems : I've been in Italy too long
[17/08/2025, 12.59.02] Ems : Pharmacy
[17/08/2025, 13.00.01] Ems : Get someone to what do you mean
[17/08/2025, 13.00.13] Ems : I'm sure your mom won't mind
[17/08/2025, 13.00.24] Yousif Zaid: No I mean I can’t scratch them anyway
[17/08/2025, 13.00.33] Yousif Zaid: I don’t have the gel but at least I can’t fuck them up by scratching
[17/08/2025, 13.01.00] Ems : True you're just going to go crazy over the next few hours
[17/08/2025, 15.27.48] Yousif Zaid: I unfortunately don’t think I can bring my cool lighter to Italy
[17/08/2025, 15.38.07] Ems : Is It over 100mls?
[17/08/2025, 15.38.11] Ems : That's weird
[17/08/2025, 15.38.31] Ems : Don't worry we can use the one that miraculously stuck with me since I was 16
[17/08/2025, 15.38.47] Ems : Through all the parties and stuff
[17/08/2025, 15.39.12] Yousif Zaid: No it’s because it contains straight up lighter fuel and I’m an Arab
[17/08/2025, 15.39.39] Yousif Zaid: That’s actually something you need to put on your CV because what the fuck
[17/08/2025, 16.10.39] Ems : You might be right
[17/08/2025, 16.10.43] Ems : Right????
[17/08/2025, 16.10.48] Ems : I'm so proud of it
[17/08/2025, 16.11.03] Yousif Zaid: I’m pretty sure I’m right about being an Arab but thanks for the vote of confidence
[17/08/2025, 16.11.26] Yousif Zaid: Claudio asked me if I knew how to check in to a flight I think he thinks I’m retarded
[17/08/2025, 16.24.38] Ems : I'm glad we agree
[17/08/2025, 16.24.48] Ems : Airport dad mode
[17/08/2025, 16.25.06] Yousif Zaid: I checked in and printed the ticket
[17/08/2025, 16.25.13] Yousif Zaid: I’m excited for my morning terminal pint
[17/08/2025, 16.29.02] Ems : I want to see proof of the 8am beer
[17/08/2025, 16.29.12] Ems : 7.30 actually
[17/08/2025, 16.29.21] Yousif Zaid: Flight leaves a bit late for this I think?
[17/08/2025, 16.29.45] Yousif Zaid: Tell you what the first stop after the security check will be the bar
[17/08/2025, 16.32.09] Yousif Zaid: Nevermind the gate closes at 8:10 which means I should be past security by 07:00
[17/08/2025, 16.32.17] Yousif Zaid: 7:15 pint incoming
[17/08/2025, 16.32.19] Ems : Yeah I was gonna say
[17/08/2025, 16.32.27] Ems : So cool
[17/08/2025, 16.32.46] Yousif Zaid: Is it too warm to wear pants by the way
[17/08/2025, 16.33.33] Ems : I think one of the best experiences was when we were flying to Thailand and there was a layover so on the next flight it was 7.30 in Italy but like 1pm there so I had a gin tonic
[17/08/2025, 16.33.47] Ems : You might be fine with linen but it is very warm
[17/08/2025, 16.35.14] Yousif Zaid: That sounds lovely. On our class trip to Greece our entire class was in the duty free shopping but me and Louis were in the airport sports bar and we got 2 pints down each before the flight
[17/08/2025, 16.42.18] Yousif Zaid: I really really like jeans though
[17/08/2025, 16.59.17] Ems : Then bring them you're going to be warm but you'll survive
[17/08/2025, 16.59.25] Ems : Let me check the weather
[17/08/2025, 17.00.29] Ems : Ok right now it's thundering, it's going to get sunny by the time you're here and it should be too hot
[17/08/2025, 17.00.32] Ems : Max is 31
[17/08/2025, 17.01.01] Yousif Zaid: 31 is too hot for jeans? I’ll bring linen pants and a pair of baggy jeans
[17/08/2025, 17.06.36] Ems : You should be fine with that
[17/08/2025, 18.18.23] Ems : I finished the book and I kind of have mixed feelings about it
[17/08/2025, 18.19.03] Ems : It was beautifully written and some quotes were lovely, I'm not sure about the characters and the ending though
[17/08/2025, 18.19.53] Yousif Zaid: This was the one with the interesting name yes?
[17/08/2025, 18.20.42] Yousif Zaid: The intelligence of a marmot
[17/08/2025, 18.23.53] Yousif Zaid: Do you think I should read it?
[17/08/2025, 18.27.33] Ems : Yes that one
[17/08/2025, 18.27.40] Ems : Let me think about it
[17/08/2025, 18.27.49] Yousif Zaid: What’s it about, loosely?
[17/08/2025, 18.28.21] Yousif Zaid: Really?
[17/08/2025, 18.29.31] Ems : The elegance of the edgehog hahahahah
[17/08/2025, 18.30.11] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 18.30.16] Yousif Zaid: Yeah I see it
[17/08/2025, 18.33.29] Yousif Zaid: Quite handsome he is. I’d read that book
[17/08/2025, 19.01.00] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 19.01.00] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 19.54.22] Ems : There's the famous elegance
[17/08/2025, 19.54.29] Ems : Are you dead?
[17/08/2025, 19.54.44] Ems : I feel like you probably are
[17/08/2025, 20.01.44] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[17/08/2025, 20.04.40] Ems : Looks phenomenal
[17/08/2025, 20.04.50] Ems : Minimum is about 4 beers on there
[17/08/2025, 20.05.21] Yousif Zaid: We took a six pack with us
[17/08/2025, 20.05.24] Yousif Zaid: The guys say hi
[17/08/2025, 21.46.22] Ems : Say hi back!!
[17/08/2025, 21.46.34] Yousif Zaid: I’m home
[17/08/2025, 21.46.37] Yousif Zaid: [17/08/2025, 22.03.27] Ems : Ok so my reply was a bit late
[17/08/2025, 22.03.42] Ems : We were watching TV so
[17/08/2025, 22.04.14] Ems : Was it fun?
[17/08/2025, 22.04.23] Yousif Zaid: It was a good time
[17/08/2025, 22.04.40] Yousif Zaid: Last hangout before Italy, we’re trying to organise a barbecue the day before Abid goes off to Barcelona for exchange
[17/08/2025, 22.05.17] Yousif Zaid: Italy tommorow. I’ve packed but I’m sure I’m missing something, it’s an infuriating feeling
[17/08/2025, 22.05.54] Ems : What I always think is if you have money passport and charger you're fine
[17/08/2025, 22.06.01] Ems : Everything else you can get
[17/08/2025, 22.06.08] Yousif Zaid: MONEY!
[17/08/2025, 22.06.10] Ems : Is he gone 6 months?
[17/08/2025, 22.06.24] Yousif Zaid: Yes unfortunately, Louis is gone for 6 months also. The friend group has split
[17/08/2025, 22.06.38] Ems : Did you forget?
[17/08/2025, 22.06.44] Yousif Zaid: Yes ahahahhaa thanks
[17/08/2025, 22.06.57] Ems : It's just going to be more fun when you're back together
[17/08/2025, 22.07.06] Ems : Glad to help
[17/08/2025, 22.07.20] Ems : You were just going to travel moneyless
[17/08/2025, 22.08.54] Yousif Zaid: Well I have a credit card
[17/08/2025, 22.09.02] Yousif Zaid: But I forgot to bring cash
[17/08/2025, 22.13.06] Yousif Zaid: I think so. I just had my mom do my eyebrows so I don’t look feral infront of patsy
[17/08/2025, 22.18.16] Ems : Oh good cause I know she was waiting to inspect them
[17/08/2025, 22.18.25] Ems : Ok so you're set for the pint
[17/08/2025, 22.19.23] Yousif Zaid: You don’t walk into someone’s house for the first time with 1 big eyebrow on your face
[17/08/2025, 22.26.14] Yousif Zaid: I bet you’ve never had to think about that
[17/08/2025, 22.28.36] Ems : I think you're just quite dramatic about your eyebrows
[17/08/2025, 22.28.48] Ems : Specifically about eyebrows no
[17/08/2025, 22.36.25] Yousif Zaid: When you’ve had 1 eyebrow for most of your life (started trimming it at age 12) it sticks with you
[17/08/2025, 22.41.01] Ems : The plus side is that you have a lot of hair
[17/08/2025, 22.41.21] Ems : More than me so
[17/08/2025, 22.41.28] Yousif Zaid: Yes it’s luscious
[17/08/2025, 22.41.47] Ems : Hahahahahahah
[17/08/2025, 22.41.50] Yousif Zaid: Ah but you have very nice hair also
[17/08/2025, 22.42.24] Ems : Well thank you
[17/08/2025, 22.42.30] Ems : I read this british
[17/08/2025, 22.42.57] Yousif Zaid: I’ve begun speaking in British phrases occasionally partly due to John but mostly you
[17/08/2025, 22.43.27] Ems : Do you just say "bashful" randomly now
[17/08/2025, 22.43.37] Ems : I adore the word
[17/08/2025, 22.43.41] Yousif Zaid: “It’s lovely isn’t it”
[17/08/2025, 22.43.44] Yousif Zaid: “Adore”
[17/08/2025, 22.43.54] Yousif Zaid: I end sentences in “then” for no reason
[17/08/2025, 22.44.06] Yousif Zaid: “Going to the store?” -> “going to the store then?”
[17/08/2025, 22.44.16] Yousif Zaid: “I couldn’t possibly”
[17/08/2025, 22.44.55] Ems : It sounds very gentlemany
[17/08/2025, 22.45.16] Yousif Zaid: John has me saying “cunt” and “twat” sometimes. You’re too ladylike for this
[17/08/2025, 22.45.20] Ems : There's no way to say this in an American accent I can't imagine it
[17/08/2025, 22.45.38] Ems : Eh get a few pints in me I'll start saying it
[17/08/2025, 22.45.40] Yousif Zaid: Not possible
[17/08/2025, 22.46.06] Yousif Zaid: I call John “mate” sometimes but it sounds awkward since I don’t actually have an English accent
[17/08/2025, 22.46.19] Yousif Zaid: I speak in phrases but do it in my stupid international salesman accent
[17/08/2025, 22.47.15] Ems : Alaskan
[17/08/2025, 22.47.33] Yousif Zaid: Johns wife said I sounded like a salesman and it got under my skin
[17/08/2025, 22.47.49] Yousif Zaid: They both said I’d fit in at the university of bath it’s humiliating they think I’m Harry Potter
[17/08/2025, 22.48.56] Ems : I bet you blank eyed stared her
[17/08/2025, 22.49.15] Yousif Zaid: Utterly embarrassing
[17/08/2025, 22.49.27] Ems : Utterly
[17/08/2025, 22.49.31] Yousif Zaid: They keep asking me questions that young men should know
[17/08/2025, 22.49.48] Yousif Zaid: They’re like “what’s the club scene like is dating the same as it was when we were your age”
[17/08/2025, 22.50.05] Yousif Zaid: I don’t fucking know man
[17/08/2025, 22.50.53] Ems : Hahahahahahahah
[17/08/2025, 22.51.06] Ems : The club scene is completely unknown to me
[17/08/2025, 22.51.45] Yousif Zaid: Louis’s mom got home two nights ago at 2 am from a festival for young people that I wasn’t even aware was happening
[17/08/2025, 22.52.03] Ems : That's cool of her
[17/08/2025, 22.52.10] Yousif Zaid: She was like “did you go to X event” I was like huh
[18/08/2025, 07.07.09] Yousif Zaid: Fuck me I haven’t had anything to eat yet and the airport store was giving out samples of vodka
[18/08/2025, 07.18.13] Ems : That's a really dangerous game to play
[18/08/2025, 07.18.25] Yousif Zaid: 7 am too
[18/08/2025, 07.18.26] Ems : Add the beer on top that sounds like a good idea
[18/08/2025, 07.18.32] Yousif Zaid: Duh
[18/08/2025, 07.18.43] Yousif Zaid: Why are they even giving out samples so early
[18/08/2025, 07.19.27] Ems : You can't ask yourself that AFTER taking them
[18/08/2025, 07.19.49] Yousif Zaid: I take 0 accountability
[18/08/2025, 07.26.06] Ems : You saw free vodka and lost your shit
[18/08/2025, 07.28.09] Yousif Zaid: I wouldn’t say I lost my shit I just had the one
[18/08/2025, 07.28.29] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[18/08/2025, 07.33.16] Ems : THE PINT!!
[18/08/2025, 07.33.27] Yousif Zaid: There’s a geezer sitting next to me
[18/08/2025, 07.33.36] Yousif Zaid: 80 years old at least doing the same thing
[18/08/2025, 07.34.23] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[18/08/2025, 07.36.33] Ems : You see your future in front of you
[18/08/2025, 07.36.52] Ems : How do you mean?
[18/08/2025, 07.36.59] Yousif Zaid: Me and the old man
[18/08/2025, 07.37.06] Yousif Zaid: Two stallions in an ocean of sheep
[18/08/2025, 07.37.19] Ems : Two fighters
[18/08/2025, 07.37.24] Yousif Zaid: Heroes
[18/08/2025, 07.38.55] Yousif Zaid: I don’t even know where my gate is
[18/08/2025, 07.40.57] Ems : I'm guessing F something
[18/08/2025, 07.41.14] Ems : Personal guess
[18/08/2025, 07.44.11] Yousif Zaid: Yes!!!!!
[18/08/2025, 07.44.13] Yousif Zaid: F6
[18/08/2025, 07.44.33] Yousif Zaid: I drank my pint pretty fast
[18/08/2025, 07.45.04] Yousif Zaid: Between that and the tuna sandwich I just ate I feel strange
[18/08/2025, 07.45.33] Yousif Zaid: Listening to hozier for some reason?
[18/08/2025, 07.50.11] Ems : I'm so proud of myself
[18/08/2025, 07.50.17] Ems : Which one?
[18/08/2025, 07.50.34] Ems : You're forgetting the shot
[18/08/2025, 07.50.54] Yousif Zaid: Jack and Wilson or whatever

[18/08/2025, 19.05.21] Ems : You sound tired
[18/08/2025, 19.08.33] Yousif Zaid: Okay we’re driving to the restaurant which I’m told is far and I’m hearing a lot of Italian so I’m assuming it’s not rude to text
[18/08/2025, 19.10.49] Yousif Zaid: Claudio picks me up, we go to a restaurant. I have some pappardelle with rabbit sauce, and we share chicken. I get to drive to the ice cream place, and Claudio is asking me silly questions like “why are you slowing down” when I’m barrelling down a narrow two way 50 km/h road at 100
[18/08/2025, 19.11.44] Yousif Zaid: We then visit the pagani factory in Modena which was very lovely, Claudio’s dreams basically came true

[18/08/2025, 19.15.50] Yousif Zaid: Went to the mall to pick up some things, a quick tour of the town centre (which Claudio describes as ugly but is actually very pretty) then we went to Claudio’s grandmas house
[18/08/2025, 19.16.12] Yousif Zaid: The egotistical words I memorised paid off, she called me a bello regazzo :) [18/08/2025, 19.21.32] Yousif Zaid: I got to Claudio’s house, freshened up and now we’re driving to a seafood restaurant
[18/08/2025, 19.49.28] Ems : This all sounds so lovely
[18/08/2025, 21.53.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m rubbing my eyes at dinner
[18/08/2025, 22.06.27] Ems : Are you texting from under the table
[18/08/2025, 22.06.42] Ems : You knew these dinners could go on forever
[18/08/2025, 22.08.02] Yousif Zaid: We’re in the car now
[18/08/2025, 22.08.18] Yousif Zaid: I have a very funny anecdote I can’t wait to tell you tommorow
[18/08/2025, 22.09.31] Ems : No you know how curious I am I'm going to die from this
[18/08/2025, 22.10.06] Yousif Zaid: Emma I cannot tell you this over text not only because it’s too funny (to me at least) but also because it involves a physical act I have to demonstrate
[18/08/2025, 22.11.09] Yousif Zaid: Tell me about your day
[18/08/2025, 22.24.14] Ems : Okok I'll be patient

[18/08/2025, 22.24.34] Ems : It was a nice day
[18/08/2025, 22.50.33] Yousif Zaid: We’re still an hour away from forli
[18/08/2025, 22.52.21] Ems : Just nap in the car at this point
[18/08/2025, 22.52.35] Yousif Zaid: I know if I do I can’t sleep at the house
[18/08/2025, 22.52.51] Ems : Why on earth did you go to a restaurant that far
[18/08/2025, 22.52.55] Ems : Fair enough
[18/08/2025, 22.53.04] Yousif Zaid: I just go where they tell me to man
[18/08/2025, 22.53.07] Ems : I know it wasn't your choice but like
[18/08/2025, 22.53.11] Yousif Zaid: I found out I don’t like cuttlefish tonight
[18/08/2025, 22.53.29] Yousif Zaid: Don’t tell anyone I said that I ate most of it and pretended to be full [18/08/2025, 22.53.45] Ems : I'll keep the secret don't worry
[18/08/2025, 22.53.53] Ems : It was probably just made wrong
[18/08/2025, 22.53.58] Ems : You like calamari right?

[18/08/2025, 22.54.21] Yousif Zaid: Or fried shrimps
[18/08/2025, 22.54.51] Yousif Zaid: To me, octopus and other slippery guys just tastes like fish flavored pencil eraser
[18/08/2025, 22.55.11] Ems : I strongly disagree but to each their own
[18/08/2025, 22.55.20] Yousif Zaid: The texture gets me man
[18/08/2025, 22.55.30] Ems : But then why did you order it
[18/08/2025, 22.55.42] Yousif Zaid: I was told it was like small shrimp
[18/08/2025, 22.55.56] Ems : Wait who lied
[18/08/2025, 22.56.01] Ems : What the fuck
[18/08/2025, 22.56.05] Yousif Zaid: Then I place the order and Claudio shows me a picture of this alien on his phone
[18/08/2025, 22.56.18] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
[18/08/2025, 22.56.45] Yousif Zaid: Like that’s not a real creature man
[18/08/2025, 22.57.07] Yousif Zaid: Shit looks like squidwards nose
[18/08/2025, 23.02.44] Ems : I just know It actually wouldn't cross my mind to describe it as small shrimp
[18/08/2025, 23.03.09] Yousif Zaid: He pointed at a different one and said “this is like big shrimp”
[18/08/2025, 23.03.25] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna live the rest of my life wondering what the fuck the big shrimp is if small shrimp = cuttlefish
[18/08/2025, 23.09.22] Ems : A mystery
[18/08/2025, 23.10.10] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[18/08/2025, 23.13.14] Yousif Zaid: Ironically this will stop happening once im nursing home age
[18/08/2025, 23.14.00] Ems : The only way to verify this is by waiting
[18/08/2025, 23.14.24] Ems : You never know you might be the playboy of the place
[18/08/2025, 23.14.45] Yousif Zaid: Give me old wrinkly wife or give me death

[18/08/2025, 23.16.45] Yousif Zaid: I know a 28 year old playboy and if you held a gun to my head you couldn’t honestly get me to say that I think he’s happy
[18/08/2025, 23.17.47] Ems : That might just be him
[18/08/2025, 23.18.27] Yousif Zaid: I’m very excited for tommorow

[21/08/2025, 18.38.17] Yousif Zaid: There’s definitely a point here where it turns into the apocalypse but I definitely don’t think Rome is included in the shithole

[21/08/2025, 18.42.57] Yousif Zaid: This place makes Rome look like Copenhagen Claudio’s racism is misplaced

[21/08/2025, 21.43.50] Yousif Zaid: You did a really good job showing me around
[21/08/2025, 21.46.01] Yousif Zaid: Go to sleep then ems

[22/08/2025, 05.45.54] Ems : This was one of the liked ones it's so good
[22/08/2025, 08.08.47] Yousif Zaid: We were already quite tired just after arriving in Naples but then Claudio put me through an endurance challenge where we walked for 4 hours after dinner
[22/08/2025, 08.10.03] Yousif Zaid: It’s fantastic, produced by Rick Rubin
[22/08/2025, 08.11.56] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[22/08/2025, 08.16.52] Yousif Zaid: Such a sweet song
[22/08/2025, 08.19.59] Yousif Zaid: By the way I’m sure you’ll be happy to know that I was actually pinched on the butt yesterday by an old lady
[22/08/2025, 08.37.22] Ems : The boy scout has done it again
[22/08/2025, 08.37.33] Ems : That's talent
[22/08/2025, 08.38.04] Ems : Hahahahahahahah
[22/08/2025, 08.38.07] Ems : Do tell
[22/08/2025, 08.38.36] Yousif Zaid: Not much to tell, was walking on the street, strange lady got a finger full of Yousif
[22/08/2025, 08.39.03] Ems : That's really not nice I'm sorry
[22/08/2025, 08.39.37] Yousif Zaid: I immediately remembered the “don’t get molested in Naples” thing and burst out laughing while Claudio was trying to explain a monument to me
[22/08/2025, 08.40.28] Yousif Zaid: No big deal I think. I just don’t get it, I’d have picked someone else if I was that lady
[22/08/2025, 08.41.51] Ems : Being bashful after being molested is crazy behaviour
[22/08/2025, 08.41.55] Yousif Zaid: I appreciate that she didn’t pinch very hard
[22/08/2025, 08.43.29] Ems : Least she could do
[22/08/2025, 08.43.56] Yousif Zaid: You’re in Utrecht ?
[22/08/2025, 09.43.54] Ems : We're in Manchester going to Leeds
[22/08/2025, 10.13.30] Yousif Zaid: Have a pub meal on my behalf would you?

[22/08/2025, 13.33.50] Ems : Amazing
[22/08/2025, 13.33.59] Ems : You're actually not
[22/08/2025, 13.34.03] Ems : I see it
[22/08/2025, 13.34.09] Ems : It's the beard
[22/08/2025, 13.34.12] Yousif Zaid: He literally has the same surname as me
[22/08/2025, 13.34.17] Ems : And the curl
[22/08/2025, 13.34.20] Yousif Zaid: Antonino Pio
[22/08/2025, 13.34.24] Yousif Zaid: The peaceful
[22/08/2025, 13.34.30] Yousif Zaid: Al Khairi means the peaceful in Arabic
[22/08/2025, 13.34.51] Ems : The more I look at it the more similar it is
[22/08/2025, 13.35.14] Yousif Zaid: Vietnamese food is nuts
[22/08/2025, 13.35.17] Ems : video omitted
[22/08/2025, 13.35.33] Ems : Cultural diversity ya know
[22/08/2025, 13.36.37] Yousif Zaid: I see this and think of our shared shower in our murder hotel that’s clogged
[22/08/2025, 13.36.57] Yousif Zaid: Nuts as in good. Viet food is amazing
[22/08/2025, 13.38.04] Yousif Zaid: When they’re not drowning ducks or eating cow vagina
[22/08/2025, 13.38.13] Ems : Notice how there's carrots on the windowsill
[22/08/2025, 13.38.22] Ems : I know right
[22/08/2025, 13.38.35] Yousif Zaid: You forgot to give me a carrot for the road
[22/08/2025, 13.38.38] Ems : That's marginal if the food is good
[22/08/2025, 13.38.49] Ems : I wanted to text you how deeply sorry I was
[22/08/2025, 13.38.56] Ems : I fully forgot
[22/08/2025, 13.39.02] Ems : Why didn't you tell me
[22/08/2025, 13.39.15] Yousif Zaid: I was sitting in the car thinking “man life would be so much better right now if I had a carrot”
[22/08/2025, 13.39.20] Yousif Zaid: Tsk tsk emma
[22/08/2025, 13.40.16] Ems : Fuck off come on
[22/08/2025, 13.40.19] Yousif Zaid: I’m pretty sure “that’s marginal” and “ya know” are yousif’isms
[22/08/2025, 13.41.34] Ems : I'll give you the ya know not the marginal
[22/08/2025, 13.41.43] Yousif Zaid: Fair enough
[22/08/2025, 13.41.43] Ems : That's an emmaism
[22/08/2025, 13.41.53] Yousif Zaid: Might just be English
[22/08/2025, 13.42.01] Ems : THAT'S an emmaism
[22/08/2025, 13.42.07] Yousif Zaid: We’re waiting in line for fried pizza
[22/08/2025, 13.42.32] Yousif Zaid: They had like some fried bullshit on the menu. It said it was made of beef and I asked and the lady said it was actually made of pork
[22/08/2025, 13.42.39] Yousif Zaid: So I had a potato thingy instead
[22/08/2025, 13.43.50] Yousif Zaid: There’s so many phrases that are claudio’isms
[22/08/2025, 13.45.23] Ems : Crocche
[22/08/2025, 13.45.27] Ems : How was it
[22/08/2025, 13.45.36] Ems : The thing is. ..
[22/08/2025, 13.45.46] Yousif Zaid: The issue is…
[22/08/2025, 13.46.02] Yousif Zaid: Very good
[22/08/2025, 13.48.29] Yousif Zaid: “You can really taste the grape” is something we’ve said maybe 100 times
[22/08/2025, 13.48.51] Ems : It applies to all the gifts you brought me so

[22/08/2025, 17.19.49] Ems : It has a certain toll on the system
[22/08/2025, 17.19.49] Ems : Hahahahahahah I sent other photos by mistake
[22/08/2025, 17.22.27] Yousif Zaid: We’ve been out in the city all day since 10 am and I’m completely fucked
[22/08/2025, 17.22.38] Yousif Zaid: I think I’ll try to renegotiate how we spend our days
[22/08/2025, 17.32.20] Yousif Zaid: I’m a bit curious I can’t lie
[22/08/2025, 19.10.32] Ems : Let me know how that goes
[22/08/2025, 19.10.33] Ems : The boy scout schedule must be tiring
[22/08/2025, 19.14.52] Yousif Zaid: Apparently this situation is unique to Naples because there’s nowhere to chill here
[22/08/2025, 19.15.56] Yousif Zaid: I’m told in pompeii we’ll just be able to find a Roman house and sit in there and live there for the day and I can chill and read
[22/08/2025, 19.16.42] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[22/08/2025, 19.19.37] Ems : How do you mean I feel like it's where you chill the nost

[22/08/2025, 19.20.40] Ems : It's like you're on a schedule
[22/08/2025, 19.20.58] Yousif Zaid: We did 15k only during our busiest day in Rome
[22/08/2025, 19.21.41] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been on a death march to see every single statue and painting in the entire city
[22/08/2025, 19.22.34] Yousif Zaid: It looks much more civilised
[22/08/2025, 19.23.04] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[22/08/2025, 19.45.39] Ems : Yeah I think with the heat it gets to a point, as you would put it
[22/08/2025, 19.45.54] Ems : God I love church ceilings
[22/08/2025, 19.51.25] Yousif Zaid: Yeah when I was in there I had a thought that you’d like it
[22/08/2025, 19.53.50] Yousif Zaid: Itd have been nicer if you were here with us
[22/08/2025, 20.01.02] Ems : This one is particularly lovely
[22/08/2025, 20.01.18] Ems : I would have loved to be there with you
[22/08/2025, 20.01.39] Ems : I bet you're going for spritzs soon
[22/08/2025, 20.04.31] Yousif Zaid: Bakery. Dinner. Hotel
[22/08/2025, 20.04.37] Yousif Zaid: Another 45 minutes of walking
[22/08/2025, 20.05.47] Yousif Zaid: It’s actually not so warm today. We had a cone full of fried bullshit. It was super nice
[22/08/2025, 20.06.04] Yousif Zaid: I also bought a nice poster, I’ll show you once I put it up in my room
[22/08/2025, 20.30.20] Ems : Well bright side is you're getting your steps in
[22/08/2025, 20.30.27] Ems : Okok I'm curious
[22/08/2025, 20.30.38] Ems : You won't believe what the fuck just happened
[22/08/2025, 20.31.22] Ems : We had bought salsa to have dinner in the hotel, Marta spilled it all over the carpet and my trousers she was wearing
[22/08/2025, 20.32.07] Ems : I was cleaning for a good 20 minutes
[22/08/2025, 20.32.38] Yousif Zaid: Classic Marta
[22/08/2025, 20.33.05] Ems : Her first reaction was "I'm going to buy more salsa" and she's in the store
[22/08/2025, 20.33.23] Yousif Zaid: She might be the realest human being I’ve ever met
[22/08/2025, 20.33.35] Ems : She got mad because I was cleaning silently instead of "getting over it"
[22/08/2025, 20.34.00] Yousif Zaid: You have to admit it’s kind of amazing the kind of mental headspace you have to be in to behave like this
[22/08/2025, 20.34.17] Ems : I would take your 40k steps instead of this any day
[22/08/2025, 20.34.38] Ems : audio omitted
[22/08/2025, 20.34.42] Yousif Zaid: I’m telling you she’s the kind of human being where I would pay money to just watch her go about her day
[22/08/2025, 20.35.06] Ems : Anything she does has a good 80% chance to make a mess
[22/08/2025, 20.35.20] Yousif Zaid: Jesus Christ
[22/08/2025, 20.35.53] Yousif Zaid: The kind of person to not know oven mitts exist
[22/08/2025, 20.36.12] Yousif Zaid: Just taking food out the oven going “ow” the whole time
[22/08/2025, 20.36.46] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[22/08/2025, 20.38.22] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[22/08/2025, 20.39.10] Yousif Zaid: I’m buying her a pony if she accidentally spills the second jar of salsa
[22/08/2025, 20.40.16] Ems : Exactly you get it
[22/08/2025, 20.40.26] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
[22/08/2025, 20.40.44] Ems : In my defence I didn't know it was closed
[22/08/2025, 20.40.48] Ems : Sorryyyy
[22/08/2025, 20.41.09] Ems : image omitted
[22/08/2025, 20.41.11] Yousif Zaid: I’m not sure my body has ever known rest at this point
[22/08/2025, 20.41.26] Yousif Zaid: The entire first jar?
[22/08/2025, 20.41.33] Yousif Zaid: She was wearing your pants too
[22/08/2025, 20.41.50] Yousif Zaid: Every younger sibling is just Mr Bean
[22/08/2025, 21.23.09] Ems : I swear to god I cleaned it all off the carpet
[22/08/2025, 21.23.26] Ems : I can vouch that there's tomatoes and onions in there
[22/08/2025, 21.23.36] Ems : .
[22/08/2025, 21.23.59] Yousif Zaid: How do you drop the entire thing
[22/08/2025, 21.28.05] Yousif Zaid: I was just informed by Claudio that it’s going to rain heavily tommorow during our Vesuvius/pompeii day trip and I’m actually trying not to burst into tears in the middle of this restaurant
[22/08/2025, 22.29.53] Ems : It's genius
[22/08/2025, 22.29.57] Ems : No way
[22/08/2025, 22.30.06] Ems : Like thunderstorms?
[22/08/2025, 22.30.09] Ems : Shit
[22/08/2025, 22.30.30] Yousif Zaid: He said hail
[22/08/2025, 22.30.49] Yousif Zaid: We walked past a woman screaming for help
[22/08/2025, 22.31.04] Yousif Zaid: It’s really bothering me that I just left
[22/08/2025, 22.32.41] Ems : What was the situation
[22/08/2025, 22.32.46] Ems : Was she far
[22/08/2025, 22.33.10] Yousif Zaid: No like 30 meters away next to a fountain
[22/08/2025, 22.33.18] Yousif Zaid: Dark corner of a park I guess?
[22/08/2025, 22.34.03] Yousif Zaid: I’m not trying to paint myself as a good person but Claudio stopped me saying it’s some kind of sketchy trick
[22/08/2025, 22.34.52] Yousif Zaid: He’s 99% right but idk man
[22/08/2025, 22.37.06] Yousif Zaid: Looked like she was overdosing or too drunk or something? Completely slumped over
[22/08/2025, 22.37.51] Ems : Mmm I mean it sounds weird
[22/08/2025, 22.38.06] Ems : Claudio is always very racist toward the south
[22/08/2025, 22.38.08] Yousif Zaid: I’m too naive for this place
[22/08/2025, 22.38.19] Ems : No I mean
[22/08/2025, 22.38.28] Ems : He's too racist
[22/08/2025, 22.38.36] Ems : But don't worry she's fine I'm sure
[22/08/2025, 22.38.52] Yousif Zaid: I really hope so
[22/08/2025, 22.39.02] Ems : Somebody helped I'm sure of it
[22/08/2025, 22.39.05] Ems : Don't worry
[22/08/2025, 22.39.42] Yousif Zaid: I’m sad to say I’m past my peak years of eating also
[22/08/2025, 22.40.05] Yousif Zaid: 30k steps today and I couldn’t even finish my gnocchi for dinner I don’t know what’s happening to me
[22/08/2025, 22.40.19] Yousif Zaid: Thanks for trying to make me feel better about it
[22/08/2025, 22.41.03] Ems : You were acting like a little bitch about a bowl of yogurt to be honest
[22/08/2025, 22.41.14] Ems : I put 4 of those down
[22/08/2025, 22.41.42] Ems : I'm glad if it helped In Naples they're very nice towards each other so it's fine
[22/08/2025, 22.41.55] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna choose to believe you
[22/08/2025, 22.42.03] Yousif Zaid: It was a big bowl!
[22/08/2025, 22.42.22] Yousif Zaid: Also ingesting appetite suppressants in the form of grape snus doesn’t help
[22/08/2025, 22.44.18] Ems : See you don't have that excuse because I took those with you
[22/08/2025, 22.44.27] Ems : I think it's the heat though
[22/08/2025, 22.44.33] Ems : 100%
[22/08/2025, 22.44.46] Yousif Zaid: Does the heat make you not hungry?
[22/08/2025, 22.44.46] Ems : I'm so much less hungry during the summer
[22/08/2025, 22.44.52] Ems : Yes
[22/08/2025, 22.45.05] Yousif Zaid: If this was a conversation in real life Marta would call me Bella hadid and I’d tell her to shut up
[22/08/2025, 22.45.32] Ems : She did actually when she saw the greek yogurt thing
[22/08/2025, 22.45.36] Ems : Hahahahahahahah
[22/08/2025, 22.45.50] Yousif Zaid: Ahahahahhahahaha
[22/08/2025, 22.46.19] Yousif Zaid: A 17 year old girl making fun of me for how little I ate kind of hurts
[22/08/2025, 22.49.59] Ems : It's the heat I'm telling you
[22/08/2025, 22.50.19] Yousif Zaid: I get the vibe of what you mean
[22/08/2025, 22.50.30] Yousif Zaid: Cold winter night? Pot of stew so you don’t die
[22/08/2025, 22.51.27] Ems : image omitted
[22/08/2025, 22.51.58] Yousif Zaid: I also have not peed all day despite consuming a bottle of water an hour
[22/08/2025, 23.05.17] Ems : The tourist life is really getting to you
[22/08/2025, 23.05.30] Yousif Zaid: Where is the water going
[22/08/2025, 23.05.34] Yousif Zaid: Tell me muse
[22/08/2025, 23.06.44] Ems : The question is
[22/08/2025, 23.07.00] Ems : How much did you sweat during the day walking around
[22/08/2025, 23.07.06] Ems : That might solve it
[22/08/2025, 23.07.18] Yousif Zaid: A lot but not half a liter an hour
[22/08/2025, 23.07.41] Ems : Then it evaporated out of you idk yuyu
[22/08/2025, 23.07.45] Yousif Zaid: How are you enjoying Leeds

[24/08/2025, 23.42.29] Yousif Zaid: Ems You’re probably asleep so tell me your impressions of Amsterdam tomorrow

[25/08/2025, 09.57.57] Yousif Zaid: He does, but it’s a bit cigarette behind the ear sometimes
[25/08/2025, 09.59.29] Yousif Zaid: They’ve adopted his music unfortunately
[25/08/2025, 10.16.24] Ems : It's just good music I think
If you have a book in the back pocket, that's when I'm going to judge

[25/08/2025, 10.53.04] Yousif Zaid: It’s very funny

[25/08/2025, 10.55.20] Yousif Zaid: It looked like a sex dungeon so me and Claudio played rock paper scissors for the big bed
[25/08/2025, 10.55.25] Yousif Zaid: Not sharing that with him here
[25/08/2025, 10.55.58] Yousif Zaid: I felt kind of bad but he just shouldn’t have picked Rock

[25/08/2025, 13.31.36] Ems : Uuuu parmigiana inside

[25/08/2025, 13.32.35] Ems : video omitted
[25/08/2025, 13.32.49] Ems : She likes it I think she mostly wants to see Utrecht though
[25/08/2025, 13.34.11] Yousif Zaid: You guys need a blanket
[25/08/2025, 13.34.20] Yousif Zaid: “Set up a picnic” you sat on the ground
[25/08/2025, 13.36.06] Yousif Zaid: I can’t believe I ate that whole thing without spilling anything on my white shirt
[25/08/2025, 14.06.49] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[25/08/2025, 15.37.29] Ems : That's for fancy people, we were happy with grass and sun
[25/08/2025, 15.37.46] Ems : Really impressive I must admit
[25/08/2025, 15.38.24] Ems : Ok I'll listen to it wait
[25/08/2025, 15.41.55] Ems : It's really really sweet and quite nostalgic if that makes sense
[25/08/2025, 16.34.04] Yousif Zaid: It’s doubly nostalgic for me because I used to listen to it when I had crushes on girls in the 4th and 5th grade
[25/08/2025, 16.35.48] Yousif Zaid: 12 year old Yousif was a sappy loser
[25/08/2025, 17.13.00] Ems : You're too hard on him you know how to play guitar thanks to him
[25/08/2025, 17.40.20] Yousif Zaid: You’re right but he was also a big snob
[25/08/2025, 18.30.09] Ems : I've gotten more id checks in the last 24 hours than in the past year
[25/08/2025, 18.30.19] Ems : Apparently I don't look 18
[25/08/2025, 18.31.03] Yousif Zaid: This only means we get to go to museums together for free
[25/08/2025, 18.32.41] Yousif Zaid: You could be your sisters age
[25/08/2025, 18.32.53] Yousif Zaid: I would believe it, I mean
[25/08/2025, 18.33.56] Ems : I think we have at least another good year
[25/08/2025, 18.34.20] Ems : It's weird though because in ponza they said I looked much older
[25/08/2025, 18.34.27] Yousif Zaid: I, on the other hand, am a bit cooked
[25/08/2025, 18.36.16] Yousif Zaid: That’s just not true
[25/08/2025, 18.36.33] Yousif Zaid: You look like a rabbit
[25/08/2025, 18.46.44] Ems : It's fine you're 18 in five months

[25/08/2025, 19.36.57] Yousif Zaid: Emma you would die if you saw where we were staying tonight
[25/08/2025, 20.15.57] Ems : Ok I'll take the compliment

[25/08/2025, 21.22.27] Yousif Zaid: The book has gotten more tolerable
[25/08/2025, 21.23.15] Yousif Zaid: What are you and Marta up to? Me and Claudio are at a nice restaurant
[25/08/2025, 22.08.02] Yousif Zaid: Yeah so me and Claudio had eggplant, a pasta, and shared a lamb
[25/08/2025, 22.08.25] Yousif Zaid: The eggplant was the best eggplant I ever ate, the pasta was the best pasta I ever ate (Claudio thought so too), and the lamb was the best lamb I ever ate

[26/08/2025, 08.10.29] Yousif Zaid: I said hi to a Japanese guy who happened to speak some Iraqi Arabic which really confused me

[26/08/2025, 08.17.15] Yousif Zaid: We had the same idea then
[26/08/2025, 08.17.41] Yousif Zaid: I said I was Iraqi and he went “ohhhhhhhh Salam o alaikum!” In a thick Japanese accent it was so cute
[26/08/2025, 08.18.13] Yousif Zaid: Yes but honestly the citadel is so nice I don’t really want to leave. I wish I could stay here until lunch at least just lazing around so I can eat at that same restaurant again
[26/08/2025, 08.18.52] Yousif Zaid: You deleted this message.
[26/08/2025, 08.19.08] Yousif Zaid: So the sister smoking days are over? Sad
[26/08/2025, 09.38.13] Ems : Great minds
[26/08/2025, 09.38.21] Ems : I know right??
[26/08/2025, 09.39.43] Ems : I swear I hate when Italians make small talk with me in hotels just because they hear me speak the language
[26/08/2025, 09.40.13] Ems : It's not like just because we come from the same country we need to talk
[26/08/2025, 09.40.48] Yousif Zaid: Are they friendly at least
[26/08/2025, 09.41.22] Ems : I mean sure but I don't need to have a 20 minute conversation about the shitty buses
[26/08/2025, 09.41.25] Yousif Zaid: Maybe they miss home? I’m always comforted by speaking to Arabic women my moms ages
[26/08/2025, 09.41.31] Yousif Zaid: Yeah that sounds like torture
[26/08/2025, 09.41.30] Ems : They're shit, get over it
[26/08/2025, 09.42.12] Ems : The one from today I think was just a bit nervous because it was his first intro day for the master
[26/08/2025, 09.42.30] Ems : I told him they're going to make them play games and all that
[26/08/2025, 09.42.40] Ems : Hopefully not dance for them
[26/08/2025, 09.43.16] Yousif Zaid: I dont think they’re as psychotic over there as we are at DTU
[26/08/2025, 09.43.38] Yousif Zaid: The humanities students probably know how to socialise and don’t need to be forced into a cult just to say hi to each other
[26/08/2025, 09.44.05] Ems : He was in physics but I think it's still applies
[26/08/2025, 09.44.10] Ems : It's a dry problem

[26/08/2025, 09.48.48] Ems : How cool that you were in the Amalfi coast
[26/08/2025, 09.48.58] Yousif Zaid: Claudio is lecturing me on windows and other shit and I’ve begun responding with open hostility
[26/08/2025, 09.49.38] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t know how to open the old timey windows in our hotel room here and he’s like “have you never opened a window before in your life” and I’m just responding “bite me”
[26/08/2025, 09.53.48] Yousif Zaid: It’s all in good fun nobody is mad
[26/08/2025, 09.55.51] Ems : "the thing is, in Italy..."
[26/08/2025, 09.55.56] Ems : I'm sure
[26/08/2025, 09.56.34] Yousif Zaid: “Usually the last person to enter the room closes the door”
[26/08/2025, 09.56.46] Yousif Zaid: Bite me
[26/08/2025, 09.56.58] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA

[26/08/2025, 10.01.26] Yousif Zaid: This one actually annoyed me
[26/08/2025, 10.01.50] Ems : Yeah cause he was actually lecturing you
[26/08/2025, 10.02.06] Yousif Zaid: Like my nuts bro I didn’t see her
[26/08/2025, 10.02.36] Ems : "behave" HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA

[26/08/2025, 10.03.22] Yousif Zaid: Oh I shouldn’t gossip don’t bring this up with him
[26/08/2025, 10.04.00] Ems : Do you even know me why would I do that
[26/08/2025, 10.04.56] Yousif Zaid: You’re right
[26/08/2025, 10.05.05] Yousif Zaid: “Behave” fuck outta here man
[26/08/2025, 10.07.54] Ems : This behave sounds like a mom saying "yousif we can't take you anywhere"
[26/08/2025, 10.07.59] Ems : It's really funny actually
[26/08/2025, 10.08.28] Yousif Zaid: The thing that gets me is I feel like I’m generally polite
[26/08/2025, 10.08.35] Yousif Zaid: I just didn’t see her

[26/08/2025, 14.03.54] Yousif Zaid: I got some better shit
[26/08/2025, 14.04.01] Yousif Zaid: Paid 10 euros to get into the duomo

[26/08/2025, 14.04.49] Yousif Zaid: That looks lovely. Is it both your parents with you there?

[26/08/2025, 14.04.54] Ems : Yep
[26/08/2025, 14.05.05] Ems : Worth it for this
[26/08/2025, 14.05.33] Yousif Zaid: I knew you’d fuck with it
[26/08/2025, 14.05.51] Yousif Zaid: Joke around with the idea of smoking weed with them see how they respond
[26/08/2025, 14.07.25] Yousif Zaid: There’s a couple here at this restaurant and I just watched the husband give actual mouth to mouth to his wife. Like he breathed and shit
[26/08/2025, 14.21.11] Yousif Zaid: I just smiled at a crying baby and it started screaming ahahhahahahahahha
[26/08/2025, 14.48.43] Ems : Do you want to see me permanently banned from leaving Italy?

[26/08/2025, 14.49.35] Yousif Zaid: I told my mom I smoked not my dad
[26/08/2025, 14.49.54] Yousif Zaid: Would be a bit tragic. You’d need to get a job to pay your rent on your own
[26/08/2025, 14.50.14] Ems : No I just talked with him in June once that I've tried it and he just told me his experience
[26/08/2025, 14.50.24] Ems : We were just talking

[26/08/2025, 14.50.37] Yousif Zaid: My mom asked me how it made me feel and I think I said “retarded”
[26/08/2025, 14.50.52] Yousif Zaid: It does have that effect

[26/08/2025, 14.51.50] Yousif Zaid: If we really want, it’s possible
[26/08/2025, 14.51.59] Ems : Who recommended the restaurant?

[26/08/2025, 18.18.25] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[26/08/2025, 18.31.54] Ems : Isn't it gorgeous??
[26/08/2025, 18.32.02] Yousif Zaid: It is!
[26/08/2025, 18.32.32] Yousif Zaid: Often Claudio has to tap me on the shoulder and tell me to look up
[26/08/2025, 18.33.11] Ems : This one is actually beautiful
[26/08/2025, 18.33.18] Ems : It's the perspective of it
[26/08/2025, 18.33.21] Yousif Zaid: It reallly is
[26/08/2025, 18.33.42] Yousif Zaid: There is apparently a roof that is painted to look like a dome
[26/08/2025, 18.33.45] Yousif Zaid: But it isn’t really
[26/08/2025, 18.36.17] Ems : That makes it even more interesting
[26/08/2025, 18.36.36] Yousif Zaid: It’s flat and the guy who painted it just did some perspective fuckery
[26/08/2025, 18.37.33] Yousif Zaid: We studied it in high school
[26/08/2025, 18.37.40] Yousif Zaid: Dimmi (Italian) [26/08/2025, 18.40.55] Yousif Zaid: Call me if you like

[27/08/2025, 17.40.20] Ems : No way this is beautiful
[27/08/2025, 17.40.38] Ems : I can't tell but I don't think this is perspective right?

[27/08/2025, 17.43.39] Yousif Zaid: Yeah are you sure you’re hydrating enough?
[27/08/2025, 17.43.43] Ems : They have a few that are perspective but they are very rare
[27/08/2025, 17.44.02] Yousif Zaid: In Rome there was also the Sistine chapel that I’m a bit sad to not see
[27/08/2025, 17.44.13] Ems : No I've been in a car since 2 and haven't had a sip of water How tf did you guess
[27/08/2025, 17.44.23] Ems : I'm going to drink some now
[27/08/2025, 17.44.28] Yousif Zaid: The ems I know would have picked up on the michi
[27/08/2025, 17.44.28] Ems : Good idea
[27/08/2025, 17.44.35] Ems : You're right
[27/08/2025, 17.44.41] Ems : I'll hydrate
[27/08/2025, 17.44.52] Yousif Zaid: It’s kind of a backhanded compliment isn’t it? “You’re acting retarded it’s unlike you, drink water”
[27/08/2025, 17.45.00] Ems : I knowww I tried to get tickets they were sold out
[27/08/2025, 17.45.14] Ems : Yes it is you could have just called me stupid
[27/08/2025, 17.45.18] Ems : I appreciate it

[27/08/2025, 17.46.15] Ems : I'll invite you you're always welcome
[27/08/2025, 17.46.21] Ems : Just don't text her good morning
[27/08/2025, 17.46.30] Ems : That would automatically make you uninvited
[27/08/2025, 17.46.38] Yousif Zaid: I know YOUD invite me this is being done for the love of the game
[27/08/2025, 17.46.52] Ems : Mmm ok
[27/08/2025, 17.47.13] Yousif Zaid: The word amateur comes from amare. Literally to do something for the love of it
[27/08/2025, 17.47.34] Yousif Zaid: Are seasonal greetings ok?
[27/08/2025, 17.48.32] Ems : That's lovely I didn't know

[27/08/2025, 17.48.59] Ems : Birthday is September 3rd
[27/08/2025, 17.49.07] Yousif Zaid: Omg it’s raining
[27/08/2025, 17.49.15] Ems : Are you sure YOU'RE hydrated?
[27/08/2025, 17.49.25] Ems : You start getting philosophical when you're tired
[27/08/2025, 17.49.34] Ems : Questioning life and shit
[27/08/2025, 17.49.35] Yousif Zaid: I’m way too hydrated I gotta shake hands with an old friend real badly
[27/08/2025, 17.49.52] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[27/08/2025, 17.50.04] Yousif Zaid: Tired. Yes
[27/08/2025, 17.50.16] Yousif Zaid: I had a big sandwich for lunch and then a beer and not great sleep
[27/08/2025, 17.50.27] Yousif Zaid: Don’t tell Claudio I told you this but he’s a bedsheet hogger
[27/08/2025, 17.50.52] Yousif Zaid: Woke up this morning and the boy done wrapped himself like a burrito and I had half my torso exposed
[27/08/2025, 17.52.57] Ems : Really? I wouldn't have guessed
[27/08/2025, 17.53.01] Yousif Zaid: Invaded my half of the bed too.
[27/08/2025, 17.53.06] Ems : Just thank god it's warm then
[27/08/2025, 17.53.20] Yousif Zaid: Play stupid games win stupid prizes I’m gonna spoon him if he does it again
[27/08/2025, 17.53.49] Ems : If that happens you're allowed to shove people
[27/08/2025, 17.53.54] Ems : Or that
[27/08/2025, 17.54.52] Yousif Zaid: I feel like spooning him is the more psychologically damaging thing to do
[27/08/2025, 17.58.41] Ems : I think you'd probably solve the problem In one go
[27/08/2025, 18.59.47] Ems : If you look at dtu's last story there's GE people doing the intro dances it will make your day
[27/08/2025, 18.59.56] Ems : It's awful
[27/08/2025, 19.03.57] Yousif Zaid: You know, I was strongly considering hurling myself into the river of Florence before reading your text message
[27/08/2025, 19.04.28] Yousif Zaid: I went into Instagram and would like to thank you for the relief, and the uncertainty that you’ve alleviated, because you’ve convinced me to finally do it, you’ve helped me answer the “to be or not to be” [27/08/2025, 19.04.40] Yousif Zaid: You’re a doll ems
[27/08/2025, 19.23.11] Ems : Are you ok yuyu?
[27/08/2025, 19.23.29] Ems : It was too amazing not to share
[27/08/2025, 19.23.47] Yousif Zaid: I could have gone the rest of my life not hearing that skibidi song
[27/08/2025, 19.24.23] Yousif Zaid: Yes
[27/08/2025, 19.24.34] Yousif Zaid: I’m just a drama queen, as Marta would put it
[27/08/2025, 19.24.39] Yousif Zaid: A bit too sweaty and humid
[27/08/2025, 19.24.41] Ems : It definitely caused some PTSD
[27/08/2025, 19.25.18] Ems : video omitted

[27/08/2025, 19.57.15] Yousif Zaid: It’s bittersweet and I can’t tell if it’s more bitter or sweet if that makes sense
[27/08/2025, 19.57.29] Yousif Zaid: Like the last day of high school, that’s what it sounds like
[27/08/2025, 20.15.56] Ems : I think I got the energy genes
[27/08/2025, 20.16.15] Ems : Yeah I knew you would like it I really love it

[27/08/2025, 21.42.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m having a lot of fun on this trip and I appreciate everything Claudio is doing by showing me these places don’t get me wrong. I just get cranky when I’m tired, and I’m exhausted, if that makes sense
[27/08/2025, 22.01.21] Ems : It does honestly
[27/08/2025, 22.01.48] Ems : Why is it 6 am? Can't you negotiate like 8
[27/08/2025, 22.01.59] Ems : It's not a holiday if you're not having fun
[27/08/2025, 22.02.44] Ems : It's been a few tiring days
[27/08/2025, 22.03.47] Ems : He's very proud btw
[27/08/2025, 22.19.57] Yousif Zaid: I am having a lot of fun I’m just grumpy when I’m tired. The reason it must be so early is because we are seeing the David statue on such short notice
[27/08/2025, 22.20.30] Yousif Zaid: I should try to change this about myself, it’s very childish to be in a bad mood cuz you’re tired
[27/08/2025, 22.36.27] Ems : No I think it's just been too many days in a row, you were waking up pretty early in rome
[27/08/2025, 22.36.55] Ems : Also I'm with you in spirit, my plane is at 7 am tomorrow

[28/08/2025, 11.01.46] Ems : The hair is basically the same you're right
[28/08/2025, 11.02.30] Ems : The picture of people's heads compared to his height is impressive
[28/08/2025, 11.02.42] Ems : Quite sunny
[28/08/2025, 11.03.03] Yousif Zaid: How’s it feel being back?
[28/08/2025, 11.03.15] Yousif Zaid: I always feel a bit strange coming home after a while out
[28/08/2025, 11.03.32] Ems : You're right but I don't have my home yet so it feels even weirder
[28/08/2025, 11.03.42] Ems : I'll get it back on the 30th
[28/08/2025, 11.03.50] Ems : I'm in the library now hahahahahaha

[28/08/2025, 11.03.58] Ems : In waiting for the meeting
[28/08/2025, 11.04.00] Ems : Yes
[28/08/2025, 11.04.02] Yousif Zaid: You’re homeless :(
[28/08/2025, 11.04.25] Yousif Zaid: Actually you could just use our apartment it’s completely empty
[28/08/2025, 11.04.43] Ems : There's worse things than being homeless in Denmark let's be honest
[28/08/2025, 11.05.08] Ems : Thank you but I don't think it's practical first of all because I don't have a key
[28/08/2025, 11.05.11] Yousif Zaid: You could be not homeless in Naples for example
[28/08/2025, 11.05.26] Ems : Do not shit on Naples
[28/08/2025, 11.05.38] Ems : Imagine being homeless in greece
[28/08/2025, 11.05.48] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t think it would be practical but if you want my parents have the key, is all
[28/08/2025, 11.05.55] Yousif Zaid: Greece is much worse
[28/08/2025, 11.06.14] Yousif Zaid: I genuinely think Claudio’s dislike for the south is completely unjustified
[28/08/2025, 11.06.18] Yousif Zaid: Except for Naples
[28/08/2025, 11.06.35] Yousif Zaid: If Vesuvius exploded I wouldn’t lose much sleep over it
[28/08/2025, 11.06.48] Ems : Thank you for the offer I appreciate it
[28/08/2025, 11.07.15] Yousif Zaid: It’s funny that there’s some girl living in your apartment who refuses to leave for 2 more days
[28/08/2025, 11.07.25] Ems : I think you're being harsh and you didn't see it with the right frame of mind
[28/08/2025, 11.07.32] Ems : She did pay..
[28/08/2025, 11.07.41] Ems : I might go to Hemel to have lunch though
[28/08/2025, 11.07.45] Ems : Hempel
[28/08/2025, 11.07.59] Yousif Zaid: It’s difficult to be in the right frame of mind with 34 thousand steps
[28/08/2025, 11.08.07] Ems : Although I'm considering just going into the room and getting my laptop without her knowing
[28/08/2025, 11.08.24] Ems : Blame it on the boy scout then not on the city
[28/08/2025, 11.08.28] Yousif Zaid: Are you nose-diving into dtu social life again or are you gonna hide away until semester start [28/08/2025, 11.08.47] Ems : Hide away just today except for marta
[28/08/2025, 11.08.51] Ems : Because I'm tired

[28/08/2025, 11.09.20] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been living with my parents all summer
[28/08/2025, 11.10.06] Ems : Are you going to do it on the 30th?
[28/08/2025, 11.10.21] Yousif Zaid: I think so? That way the 31st can be for enjoyment
[28/08/2025, 11.10.28] Yousif Zaid: Sheep on the 31st?
[28/08/2025, 11.10.33] Ems : I have all my stuff in suitcases inside a wardrobe so I'll have to unpack a ton
[28/08/2025, 11.10.42] Yousif Zaid: My boy Abid is having a going away party on the evening of the 31st
[28/08/2025, 11.11.04] Ems : Sure I also have to print some stuff but it sounds good

[28/08/2025, 11.21.06] Ems : I think it was worth it
[28/08/2025, 11.21.16] Ems : This is beautiful
[28/08/2025, 11.21.32] Ems : But
[28/08/2025, 11.21.39] Ems : 45 minutes is way too long
[28/08/2025, 11.27.10] Yousif Zaid: Had to get the ceiling pics
[28/08/2025, 11.33.17] Ems : I love how my camera roll looks
[28/08/2025, 11.33.30] Ems : Full of gorgeous ceilings

[28/08/2025, 11.33.42] Yousif Zaid: So any dumb photo I send you gets saved?
[28/08/2025, 11.34.34] Ems : Yup phone saves everything
[28/08/2025, 11.34.51] Yousif Zaid: So when I send you a photo of me twisting my own nipple and going “ow”
[28/08/2025, 11.34.57] Ems : Seeing people have their intro days is making me annoyed for some reason
[28/08/2025, 11.35.01] Ems : Saved automatically
[28/08/2025, 11.35.12] Yousif Zaid: That’s kind of awesome
[28/08/2025, 11.35.18] Yousif Zaid: Longing for your youth?
[28/08/2025, 11.35.38] Ems : It's the same conversations over and over again I'm hating most people
[28/08/2025, 11.35.41] Ems : Nope
[28/08/2025, 11.35.51] Ems : Hating on new dtu students
[28/08/2025, 11.36.08] Yousif Zaid: See I thought it was this because you’re becoming old soon
[28/08/2025, 11.36.37] Yousif Zaid: Me and Soheyl spent the first week spitting absolute venom at any random person who looked like we could make fun of them
[28/08/2025, 11.37.01] Ems : I am that's another reason
[28/08/2025, 11.37.13] Ems : I feel like at some point I was made fun of
[28/08/2025, 11.37.21] Yousif Zaid: You were not
[28/08/2025, 11.37.38] Ems : When you two decide to unite strengths against others your rage bait is unbeatable

[28/08/2025, 16.22.03] Yousif Zaid: Deeply unserious
[28/08/2025, 16.22.39] Yousif Zaid: How was the meeting actually?
[28/08/2025, 16.22.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m assuming this is the TA meeting

[28/08/2025, 16.25.04] Yousif Zaid: What days do you work?
[28/08/2025, 16.25.30] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna sit with the math 1a students and get them to ask you bullshit questions
[28/08/2025, 16.26.24] Ems : Just friday
[28/08/2025, 16.26.38] Ems : Why is 10 squared 100?

[28/08/2025, 16.30.55] Ems : I hope I can keep the sassyness low-key
[28/08/2025, 16.31.21] Yousif Zaid: Btw I am insulted at the lack of trust by making that photo not screenshot’able
[28/08/2025, 16.31.51] Yousif Zaid: I think if you just don’t let them realise that “English accent more intense === you’re a retard” you should be good
[28/08/2025, 16.37.38] Ems : It was kind of deserved be honest
[28/08/2025, 16.37.48] Ems : Okok this might work
[28/08/2025, 16.38.02] Yousif Zaid: I haven’t done it in a while!
[28/08/2025, 16.38.06] Yousif Zaid: It’ll defo work
[28/08/2025, 16.38.20] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna dress nice for the Boy Scout barbecue
[28/08/2025, 16.38.48] Ems : Ok
[28/08/2025, 16.39.33] Ems : How are you going to communicate
[28/08/2025, 16.39.56] Yousif Zaid: It won’t be pretty but I have a salute in mind ahhahahahah
[28/08/2025, 16.40.02] Ems : Next time I'll send a picture let's see if you're actually capable of not drawing the red dot

[28/08/2025, 16.40.23] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna be sober so Claudio can drink
[28/08/2025, 16.40.32] Yousif Zaid: And I’m told I need to drive 3 female Boy Scouts home
[28/08/2025, 16.40.40] Yousif Zaid: I refuse to call them anything but Boy Scouts
[28/08/2025, 16.43.52] Ems : Hahahahahahahah
[28/08/2025, 16.43.59] Ems : You're the DD
[28/08/2025, 16.44.08] Yousif Zaid: God fucking help them
[28/08/2025, 16.44.11] Ems : You can probably have one drink no?
[28/08/2025, 16.44.24] Yousif Zaid: I plan on having two beers, eating salads and bread
[28/08/2025, 16.44.25] Ems : I can only picture them selling biscuits
[28/08/2025, 16.44.37] Yousif Zaid: And sitting and smoking and speaking to absolutely nobody
[28/08/2025, 16.44.45] Ems : That sounds fun
[28/08/2025, 16.44.56] Yousif Zaid: They only have pork at this bbq but that’s okay it’s not about me
[28/08/2025, 16.45.13] Yousif Zaid: Might just phone Laura or another friend of mine
[28/08/2025, 16.45.25] Yousif Zaid: Maybe Louis, he’s off in his boarding school now
[28/08/2025, 16.46.25] Ems : Claudio should say something
[28/08/2025, 16.46.33] Yousif Zaid: I told him not to
[28/08/2025, 16.46.57] Ems : Mmm ok

[28/08/2025, 16.49.22] Yousif Zaid: 1. Rome
2. ⁠citadel of banio regio 3. ⁠Sorrento
4. ⁠Florence
5. ⁠Naples
6. ⁠castallamare di stabia 7. ⁠caserta
[28/08/2025, 16.51.55] Ems : Rome first that means I did a good job as a tour guide
[28/08/2025, 16.52.15] Ems : I thought you liked Castellammare?
[28/08/2025, 16.54.11] Yousif Zaid: There’s literally nothing there
[28/08/2025, 16.54.17] Yousif Zaid: Same with Caserta
[28/08/2025, 16.54.56] Yousif Zaid: 0 to do. 21 year old man on vacation leaves his hotel room dressed up and goes out in southern Europe and cannot find anything to do
[28/08/2025, 16.55.31] Yousif Zaid: 6 and 7 on the list are for this reason, the top 5 all have stuff to do but is ranked in order of enjoyment
[28/08/2025, 16.57.41] Ems : You forgot to include Forlì
[28/08/2025, 16.58.01] Yousif Zaid: I have not gone anywhere in Forli except his house
[28/08/2025, 16.58.16] Yousif Zaid: It seems cute, but completely empty

[28/08/2025, 16.58.47] Ems : Bologna maybe
[28/08/2025, 16.58.55] Yousif Zaid: Pagani museum in Modena
[28/08/2025, 16.59.02] Ems : Oh right
[28/08/2025, 16.59.07] Yousif Zaid: You can read all about it in my memoir “Yuyu in Italy”
[28/08/2025, 16.59.13] Yousif Zaid: Which will be published this September
[28/08/2025, 17.00.06] Ems : Can't wait

[28/08/2025, 17.01.05] Yousif Zaid: I honestly don’t know what to expect
[28/08/2025, 17.01.49] Ems : Biscuits probably
[28/08/2025, 17.02.03] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna ask to buy biscuits off them
[28/08/2025, 17.02.11] Yousif Zaid: Omg they’re gonna hate me I can’t not make Boy Scout jokes
[28/08/2025, 17.02.50] Yousif Zaid: I’m wishing you were coming because the jokes would be peak
[28/08/2025, 17.15.20] Ems : I would combust on the spot
[28/08/2025, 17.15.55] Yousif Zaid: I predict I’m gonna feel like a zoo animal
[28/08/2025, 17.25.12] Ems : You are it's okay
[28/08/2025, 17.57.02] Yousif Zaid: Heyy guys is anyone apart from Marta and I taking living systems as a specialization?
[28/08/2025, 17.57.07] Yousif Zaid: Felix I believe
[28/08/2025, 19.29.05] Yousif Zaid: Emma they’re all 17
[28/08/2025, 19.29.46] Yousif Zaid: One of them asked me if I liked blondes or brunettes and I said “red hair” not knowing there was a redheaded girl next to me they all fucking jumped out their seats I hope she didn’t think I was hitting on her
[28/08/2025, 19.48.27] Yousif Zaid: Omg all the 17 year old boys are asking me if I was hitting on her
[28/08/2025, 19.56.54] Ems : Oh okok
[28/08/2025, 19.57.12] Ems : YOUSIF THIS IS THE SECOND PEDOPHILE ALLEGATION

[28/08/2025, 19.58.27] Yousif Zaid: She took it well she high fived me
[28/08/2025, 19.58.43] Yousif Zaid: Also they’re not allegations they’re hyping me up
[28/08/2025, 20.01.09] Yousif Zaid: It was accidentally smooth I cannot lie to you
[28/08/2025, 20.01.15] Yousif Zaid: Plus this one was 18
[28/08/2025, 20.03.32] Ems : Hahahahahahhahah
[28/08/2025, 20.03.51] Ems : Make your move on the boy scout then it's legal
[28/08/2025, 20.04.25] Yousif Zaid: I am not even attracted to her
[28/08/2025, 20.04.41] Yousif Zaid: It crossed my mind to say “redheads generally not you” but that would be insanely rude
[28/08/2025, 20.06.08] Ems : Ufff
[28/08/2025, 20.06.18] Ems : If someone said that to me I would die
[28/08/2025, 20.06.44] Yousif Zaid: Rather have her think I’m a creep hitting on her than have her go home and cry herself to sleep
[28/08/2025, 20.06.48] Ems : video omitted
[28/08/2025, 20.06.57] Ems : Yeah that's a good guy move
[28/08/2025, 20.07.05] Yousif Zaid: Say hi!!

[28/08/2025, 20.09.57] Yousif Zaid: I played rap for Claudio’s friends in the car
[28/08/2025, 20.10.19] Yousif Zaid: It was so funny he was yelling “Travis Scott!!!” In an Italian accent
[28/08/2025, 20.13.06] Ems : audio omitted
[28/08/2025, 20.13.32] Yousif Zaid: YES EXACTLY
[28/08/2025, 21.53.10] Ems : So? Do people speak English?
[28/08/2025, 22.25.18] Yousif Zaid: 2 people here speak broken English
[28/08/2025, 22.25.23] Yousif Zaid: I was just handed a drink that was
[28/08/2025, 22.25.37] Yousif Zaid: 1. Homemade grappa
2. ⁠vodka
3. ⁠strawberry syrup
[28/08/2025, 22.25.42] Yousif Zaid: Burned my fucking nose hairs off
[28/08/2025, 22.26.00] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[28/08/2025, 22.26.04] Yousif Zaid: He is going to die
[29/08/2025, 02.20.18] Yousif Zaid: He was fine, poured it down the drain and I made him a drink that was half limoncello half aperol, which was awful, I don’t have your talents sadly
[29/08/2025, 02.22.02] Yousif Zaid: They were all very friendly, but the whole thing was very middle school party in Denmark vibes. They weren’t actually very “Boy Scout” like. I had a good time and I think they liked me. They played that paracetamol song by Calcutta that you like and I had to remember where I heard it from
[29/08/2025, 07.35.25] Ems : That sounds absolutely disgusting
[29/08/2025, 07.36.03] Ems : Ok but that might be better than the first
[29/08/2025, 07.36.37] Ems : I'm glad it was nice
[29/08/2025, 07.36.56] Ems : Wow you got home late
[29/08/2025, 07.40.26] Ems : What do you mean by middle school party vibes?
[29/08/2025, 10.41.38] Yousif Zaid: It was fucking atrocious
[29/08/2025, 10.42.07] Yousif Zaid: It was !
[29/08/2025, 10.42.40] Yousif Zaid: Sitting in a circle around a dirty table covered in bottles of alcohol. We each have our own plastic cup with our names on it
[29/08/2025, 10.42.50] Yousif Zaid: Everyone is talking about their crushes
[29/08/2025, 10.43.13] Yousif Zaid: Asking me questions like “do you prefer curvier women or very thin women”
[29/08/2025, 10.43.48] Yousif Zaid: “Would you rather a girlfriend with personality who is a bit bigger or a more boring girl with a thigh gap”
[29/08/2025, 10.46.20] Yousif Zaid: The young boys were bragging about how much they were drinking
[29/08/2025, 11.53.16] Ems : I kind of want to remake it just to taste it
[29/08/2025, 11.53.33] Ems : Awww the boy scout crushes
[29/08/2025, 11.53.46] Ems : That's a philosophical one
[29/08/2025, 11.54.05] Yousif Zaid: If we’re sacrificing an entire personality for a thigh gap then I’m not sure what we’re doing
[29/08/2025, 11.54.13] Yousif Zaid: It’s not even like the option was thin vs whale
[29/08/2025, 11.54.34] Ems : The thigh gap HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[29/08/2025, 11.54.35] Ems : Tf
[29/08/2025, 11.55.11] Yousif Zaid: Some kid was like “do you like curvy women” and I went “sure” and he went “ewwww!!” As loud as he could infront of a chubby Boy Scout lady I felt quite bad
[29/08/2025, 11.55.22] Ems : Like who you pick a person for a fucking thigh gap
[29/08/2025, 11.55.28] Ems : That's just plain rude
[29/08/2025, 11.55.48] Ems : Now I see why they were bragging about drinking
[29/08/2025, 11.55.52] Yousif Zaid: I’ve heard a lot of gross manly locker room talk in my life
[29/08/2025, 11.56.00] Yousif Zaid: Not once have I heard anybody mention a thigh gap
[29/08/2025, 11.56.13] Ems : Italian boys I'm telling you
[29/08/2025, 11.56.18] Ems : I'm not joking
[29/08/2025, 11.56.31] Yousif Zaid: Like we can’t even compromise on that??? [29/08/2025, 11.57.38] Yousif Zaid: Whenever I’d answer their questions they’d be like “yeah yeah of course personality is the most important” and wink at me like I’m some kind of feminist but my point was that lots of ppl can be pretty
[29/08/2025, 11.57.54] Yousif Zaid: I also had a full on political conversation with what I’m pretty sure was a fascist
[29/08/2025, 11.59.13] Ems : Feminist for not caring about the thigh gap is crazy
[29/08/2025, 11.59.18] Ems : The bar is so low
[29/08/2025, 11.59.23] Ems : Do tell
[29/08/2025, 12.00.37] Yousif Zaid: Like it’s not exactly feminist to like chubby women also [29/08/2025, 12.00.59] Yousif Zaid: He was afraid of mass immigration, radical Islam, transgender people
[29/08/2025, 12.01.20] Yousif Zaid: Felt that Italian culture should be preserved by force
[29/08/2025, 12.02.16] Yousif Zaid: That it should remain a Christian country, and that society is going to collapse if we accept transgender people
[29/08/2025, 12.02.58] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t really argue with him I just wanted to listen to the guy, but every time he made a point I asked him “okay how do you want to achieve that” and the only answer really is another Mussolini but he can’t say that so he’d just ignore my question
[29/08/2025, 12.27.31] Ems : What a radical thought
[29/08/2025, 12.27.48] Ems : No but how do you even argue
[29/08/2025, 12.27.57] Ems : It's just peak ignorance
[29/08/2025, 12.29.44] Yousif Zaid: A devout catholic
[29/08/2025, 12.30.13] Yousif Zaid: He did not like it when I said porco dio
[29/08/2025, 12.30.41] Ems : HAHAHAHHAAHHAHA

[29/08/2025, 12.31.26] Yousif Zaid: Like idk the boy kept claiming not to be a fascist but
[29/08/2025, 12.31.46] Yousif Zaid: His politics can only really be achieved by fascism if you get down to the practicalities of it
[29/08/2025, 12.36.13] Yousif Zaid: Said he was “proud to be a European” and I had to try not laugh at the fact that he was much much browner than me
[29/08/2025, 13.26.37] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[29/08/2025, 13.26.48] Yousif Zaid: The lady here looks so kind? Like she gives good hugs

[31/08/2025, 10.49.17] Ems : You want to meet up at like 3?
[31/08/2025, 11.00.12] Yousif Zaid: Oof that’s actually a bit late for me. If that’s the earliest you can do it maybe we reschedule?

[31/08/2025, 15.08.57] Yousif Zaid: I know, you just seemed a bit hesitant and I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, I’m never sure with these things [31/08/2025, 15.11.23] Ems : I think you're overthinking it
[31/08/2025, 15.11.30] Ems : Send me the picture of the flowers

[31/08/2025, 16.20.02] Yousif Zaid: Yes!
[31/08/2025, 16.54.59] Ems : It looks so artificial and amazing
[31/08/2025, 17.16.25] Ems : You made me want to try that
[31/08/2025, 17.16.29] Ems : image omitted
[31/08/2025, 17.16.40] Ems : This was the closest thing I had
[31/08/2025, 17.46.20] Yousif Zaid: I’m buying a bottle don’t worry
[31/08/2025, 20.49.30] Ems : So? Was it fun?
[31/08/2025, 20.49.42] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/08/2025, 20.50.19] Yousif Zaid: Yeah! Abid’s house is lovely, we sat down in the backyard and his dad grilled for us, so much food
[31/08/2025, 20.50.42] Yousif Zaid: We had to stuff our faces because not touching the things he brings us feels wrong.
[31/08/2025, 20.51.14] Yousif Zaid: They had a greenhouse with chili peppers and we drank a beer and introduced our friend to the Maria’s, he liked no one noticed the most
[31/08/2025, 20.51.30] Yousif Zaid: Then I took his guitar since he won’t be here to play it for the next 6 months
[31/08/2025, 20.55.52] Ems : I think it's the one I liked most at first listen as well
[31/08/2025, 20.55.59] Ems : Electric?
[31/08/2025, 20.56.24] Yousif Zaid: No, steel stringed acoustic, think Ed Sheeran
[31/08/2025, 20.56.39] Yousif Zaid: Or Taylor Swift, I think she plays one also
[31/08/2025, 20.57.31] Yousif Zaid: It’s still my favourite cuz I feel like it just flows so well, like towards the end where the ends of lines are interrupted by the beginning of the next one, kind of like a groovy “fade into you”
[31/08/2025, 21.09.25] Ems : Same, the melody and words are both beautiful
[31/08/2025, 22.40.14] Yousif Zaid: Just got back to the apartment, had a little drive up the coast, the stars are out tonight
[31/08/2025, 22.45.19] Ems : Sounds lovely, was the moon as gorgeous as yesterday?
[31/08/2025, 22.45.32] Ems : I studied and I'm heading to bed now
[31/08/2025, 22.45.40] Ems : Alarm is set for tomorrow
[31/08/2025, 22.46.56] Yousif Zaid: I didn’t notice the moon all night
[31/08/2025, 22.47.33] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[31/08/2025, 22.49.48] Ems : Very productive
[31/08/2025, 22.49.55] Ems : Claudio would have a stroke
[31/08/2025, 22.50.20] Yousif Zaid: He would maybe be right to
[31/08/2025, 22.50.25] Ems : Night yuyu I'll head to bed
[31/08/2025, 22.50.40] Ems : If you want to see him collapse tell him
[31/08/2025, 22.50.46] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight ems
[31/08/2025, 22.50.49] Yousif Zaid: I just fucking might
[31/08/2025, 22.50.55] Yousif Zaid: Sleep well, I’ll try to as well
[01/09/2025, 12.03.35] Yousif Zaid: Claudio left and it seems like I’m stuck with Aidan and vedant
[01/09/2025, 12.03.42] Yousif Zaid: Pray that I find the guys at 206
[01/09/2025, 12.07.43] Ems : Fuck

[01/09/2025, 14.01.00] Ems : Did you leave them hahahahah
[01/09/2025, 14.02.24] Yousif Zaid: We walked into 202 and they got in line for food and I just kept walking
[01/09/2025, 14.06.00] Yousif Zaid: I feel a bit bad about it
[01/09/2025, 14.06.09] Yousif Zaid: This bio class fucking sucks Soheyl left already
[01/09/2025, 14.13.05] Ems : You didn't have a lot of choice it's fine
[01/09/2025, 14.13.26] Ems : I'm not that surprised he left but how is it that bad?
[01/09/2025, 14.15.12] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[01/09/2025, 14.15.20] Yousif Zaid: Do you wanna look at this thing

[01/09/2025, 14.21.21] Yousif Zaid: It’s ugly
[01/09/2025, 14.21.37] Ems : It looks like AI
[01/09/2025, 14.21.37] Yousif Zaid: “The moment photosynthesis was invented” is a sentence I just heard
[01/09/2025, 14.22.07] Yousif Zaid: I’m gonna get home and catch up on math after this bullshit
[01/09/2025, 14.22.15] Yousif Zaid: What are you up to with your free evening
[01/09/2025, 14.22.35] Ems : Oh no

[01/09/2025, 14.32.52] Yousif Zaid: Maybe the deer park is also the move
[01/09/2025, 14.36.55] Ems : You should stick with it then it really nice
[01/09/2025, 14.36.59] Ems : What time are you going?
[01/09/2025, 14.37.40] Yousif Zaid: It depends I guess? When I’m done with the bio exercises and do math I’ll eat a quick dinner and go, want me to let you know?
[01/09/2025, 14.52.31] Ems : Yeah please, I have a kitchen meeting at 8 though so if it's too early for you no worries

[01/09/2025, 15.15.30] Ems : Who the fuck is teaching this

[01/09/2025, 15.15.50] Yousif Zaid: We can make it back before 8 I’m sure
[01/09/2025, 15.15.50] Ems : Truly

[01/09/2025, 16.34.10] Yousif Zaid: I calculated flow rates through blood veins
[01/09/2025, 16.35.17] Yousif Zaid: I’m so brain dead from this that I can’t do math right now, dinner and a walk then math in the evening is better, so the earlier is good actually
[01/09/2025, 16.38.23] Ems : For me as well, I'd rather eat before the meeting
[01/09/2025, 16.38.43] Ems : Look at you being a biologist

[02/09/2025, 20.33.40] Ems : Tell me go on
[02/09/2025, 20.34.47] Yousif Zaid: I walked past a comic book store and saw him on the pavement neglected, walked in and asked if it was for sale, she said no, I was drunk and slammed 150 cash on the counter and she said fine
[02/09/2025, 20.34.56] Yousif Zaid: We took him around with us all day
[02/09/2025, 20.49.11] Ems : That's kind of legendary

[02/09/2025, 21.16.31] Ems : Was this better than the bazooka?
[02/09/2025, 21.16.32] Yousif Zaid: Dimmi
[02/09/2025, 21.16.37] Ems : It's important to know
[02/09/2025, 21.16.39] Yousif Zaid: So much better
[02/09/2025, 21.16.49] Ems : Quality over quantity
[02/09/2025, 21.16.51] Ems : I see
[02/09/2025, 21.17.00] Yousif Zaid: The quality is still dogshit
[02/09/2025, 21.17.07] Yousif Zaid: It’s the trashiness I crave
[02/09/2025, 21.17.12] Yousif Zaid: Some men see prostitutes, I do this
[02/09/2025, 21.21.02] Ems : Boxing+ kebab will do that

[02/09/2025, 21.49.01] Ems : And reduce
[02/09/2025, 21.49.23] Ems : The main problem is when we drink I'll tell you that
[02/09/2025, 21.50.22] Yousif Zaid: Okay, thank you for the cope
[02/09/2025, 22.05.06] Ems : Of course
[02/09/2025, 22.05.17] Ems : It's not like I count your cigs
[02/09/2025, 22.05.23] Yousif Zaid: You should
[02/09/2025, 22.05.23] Ems : I will take them away at school

[02/09/2025, 22.12.53] Yousif Zaid: I should probably do the math exercises now. Shit
[02/09/2025, 22.12.53] Ems : It sounds amazing

[02/09/2025, 22.20.58] Ems : I know right
[02/09/2025, 22.21.11] Ems : But do maths if you feel too far behind
[02/09/2025, 22.21.27] Yousif Zaid: All I need to do is the exercises and the möbius then I’m completely caught up
[02/09/2025, 22.24.19] Ems : I also still need to do the mobius
[02/09/2025, 22.24.37] Yousif Zaid: Wanna do it together once I’ve gotten my shit in order?

[02/09/2025, 22.40.04] Yousif Zaid: For the next day?
[02/09/2025, 22.40.04] Ems : It was super juicy and crispy
[02/09/2025, 22.40.14] Ems : Couldn't have asked for better

[03/09/2025, 16.44.56] Yousif Zaid: It’s super weird, but I think I get it. Maybe if we’re infront of a blackboard I can tell you but it’s not so interesting

[03/09/2025, 20.08.24] Yousif Zaid: Well you’re more coherent now
[03/09/2025, 20.08.31] Yousif Zaid: What’s wrong with you then? Headache?
[03/09/2025, 20.15.43] Ems : It was headach, some nausea, just not great in general
[03/09/2025, 20.15.53] Ems : It got better I think
[03/09/2025, 20.16.08] Yousif Zaid: Let me know if the lemon sparkling water helps
[03/09/2025, 20.18.12] Ems : It will help my spirit that's for sure
[03/09/2025, 20.18.30] Ems : The nausea is gone anyway and I needed a walk
[03/09/2025, 20.19.41] Yousif Zaid: Honestly a really motivating sentence
[03/09/2025, 20.20.24] Yousif Zaid: Have you received your purse back btw?
[03/09/2025, 20.21.50] Ems : I'm very poetic
[03/09/2025, 20.22.00] Ems : They delivered it today when I wasn't home
[03/09/2025, 20.22.06] Ems : So they'll try again tomorrow maybe
[03/09/2025, 20.22.13] Ems : Or I go to the store
[03/09/2025, 20.24.04] Yousif Zaid: still stoked that it was actually found. i would never expect this from manchester
[03/09/2025, 20.25.34] Yousif Zaid: i forgot to ask, what ended up happening with the mirror business?
[03/09/2025, 20.33.53] Ems : image omitted
[03/09/2025, 20.34.15] Ems : I told her I'd pick it up in a few days
[03/09/2025, 20.34.40] Ems : Just tell me if and when you're free I don't want to impose
[03/09/2025, 20.39.11] Ems : I bought normal sparkling water and i have lemon juice
[03/09/2025, 20.39.20] Ems : This was a rollercoaster
[03/09/2025, 20.51.18] Yousif Zaid: fuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkk

[03/09/2025, 21.00.03] Yousif Zaid: not to shit on you or anything but its pretty fucking easy to DJ to a guy who has a 90% match with your music taste and will also listen to literally anything else
[03/09/2025, 21.00.32] Yousif Zaid: its like saying i'm a good cook cuz my dog eats whatever the fuck i make
[03/09/2025, 21.00.33] Ems : Alright god
[03/09/2025, 21.01.07] Yousif Zaid: don't get me wrong you have great taste but we like the same shit its kind of hard to fuck up ya know
[03/09/2025, 21.01.38] Ems : "Not to shit on you " and then you proceed to call what I said bullshit
[03/09/2025, 21.01.56] Yousif Zaid: look you have great taste in music but you can't be using me as an advertisement for your DJ skills is all
[03/09/2025, 21.02.15] Ems : I know I know
[03/09/2025, 21.02.32] Yousif Zaid: i said my shifts are 100% flexible. we can do it after i have numerical for example
[03/09/2025, 21.02.36] Ems : Also I listen to some badish songs I know that
[03/09/2025, 21.03.05] Yousif Zaid: maybe before the sensommer fest too

[03/09/2025, 21.04.16] Yousif Zaid: which is easier done with the MIRROR
[03/09/2025, 21.04.20] Yousif Zaid: it's all coming together man

[03/09/2025, 21.04.56] Ems : What about tomorrow afternoon?
[03/09/2025, 21.04.56] Yousif Zaid: there's 4 hours between the end of your TA stuff and when they start letting ppl in line i think it's probably fine
[03/09/2025, 21.05.08] Ems : Yeahhhh but if we want to have pres
[03/09/2025, 21.05.11] Ems : If

[03/09/2025, 21.06.14] Ems : It's too rushed?

[03/09/2025, 21.06.51] Yousif Zaid: is the lady okay with us grabbing the mirror later into the day?
[03/09/2025, 21.07.17] Ems : I don't think she minds the time, which time are you thinking?
[03/09/2025, 21.07.46] Yousif Zaid: jaap wants to start jogging at 17. I'll pass out and shit myself after half an hour of jogging. that means i can be ready to leave with you at about 18.00
[03/09/2025, 21.08.15] Yousif Zaid: this isnt a rough estimate btw i cannot jog for more than a half hour
[03/09/2025, 21.10.58] Yousif Zaid: you literally don't have to ask if i want to have pres are you out of your mind
[03/09/2025, 21.14.54] Ems : Very fair
[03/09/2025, 21.15.04] Ems : I like the way you think
[03/09/2025, 21.15.16] Ems : image omitted
[03/09/2025, 21.15.18] Ems : It's perfect

[03/09/2025, 21.16.57] Yousif Zaid: we gave elizabeth bennet tonic water to cure her hysteria

[03/09/2025, 21.20.08] Yousif Zaid: i'm buying you a bonnet
[03/09/2025, 21.20.29] Ems : I would send a vocal message of me saying these but you would never let me live it down
[03/09/2025, 21.20.35] Ems : I would deserve one
[03/09/2025, 21.20.37] Ems : Honestly
[03/09/2025, 21.20.44] Yousif Zaid: what is there to "live down" you literally talk like that on a day to day basis
[03/09/2025, 21.21.14] Yousif Zaid: one day i'm gonna walk up to you with a shit eating grin on my face and place a bonnet on your head
[03/09/2025, 21.23.58] Ems : You don't realise what a compliment this is for me
[03/09/2025, 21.24.23] Yousif Zaid: lady we're not having an argument i tell you i like the british english more at least once a week
[03/09/2025, 21.24.38] Ems : I would look extra stupid cause you would probably get me the ugliest bonnet out there
[03/09/2025, 21.24.53] Yousif Zaid: i'm thinking one that the shepherd girls with canes wear
[03/09/2025, 21.24.57] Ems : I never have it fully on you know

[03/09/2025, 21.27.36] Ems : Oh by the way

[03/09/2025, 21.28.16] Yousif Zaid: I'll be there
[03/09/2025, 21.28.20] Ems : Take a break from work and come

[04/09/2025, 09.39.56] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[04/09/2025, 09.57.44] Ems : Fancy bitch
[04/09/2025, 09.57.54] Ems : I have to say it looks way more appetizing
[04/09/2025, 09.58.02] Ems : It's so appealing for no reason
[04/09/2025, 09.58.26] Yousif Zaid: It’s way better like this
[04/09/2025, 09.58.35] Yousif Zaid: They ran out of mugs I’m not just doing this because I’m an asshole
[04/09/2025, 10.05.50] Yousif Zaid: The brown/beige gradient
[04/09/2025, 10.17.42] Ems : That's why I always make my cappuccino in glass cups
[04/09/2025, 10.17.52] Ems : I love when it does this
[04/09/2025, 10.18.09] Yousif Zaid: You gotta try the champagne glass
[04/09/2025, 10.18.12] Ems : Champagne glass is classier though
[04/09/2025, 10.18.15] Ems : Exactly
[04/09/2025, 10.18.19] Ems : Different taste I bet
[04/09/2025, 10.18.25] Yousif Zaid: Different aura
[04/09/2025, 10.18.43] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[04/09/2025, 10.51.24] Ems : No I haven't

[04/09/2025, 14.31.10] Ems : Trust me don't
[04/09/2025, 14.31.34] Ems : It's already in the past and sometimes apologizing just makes things more obvious
[04/09/2025, 14.31.41] Ems : Like you bring stuff back up
[04/09/2025, 14.32.03] Ems : We're already done it's great We only had to put names on the lab coats

[04/09/2025, 15.03.48] Ems : Fuck you're so right
[04/09/2025, 15.04.05] Ems : We look like female versions of the Jonas brothers
[04/09/2025, 15.04.07] Yousif Zaid: Like not a good one I’m sorry. That’s just cuz of the lab coats
[04/09/2025, 15.04.34] Yousif Zaid: Would you listen to a band that wears lab coats
[04/09/2025, 15.08.33] Yousif Zaid: Wait this is an important question: do you like the Jonas brothers
[04/09/2025, 15.10.35] Ems : I think it depends
[04/09/2025, 15.10.42] Ems : I don't know one song of theirs
[04/09/2025, 15.10.45] Ems : Not one
[04/09/2025, 15.10.49] Ems : So I can't answer
[04/09/2025, 15.12.56] Yousif Zaid: It was a trick question and you passed. This is the only right answer, I don’t know a single song either
[04/09/2025, 15.13.40] Ems : Glad I passed this one
[04/09/2025, 15.14.00] Ems : image omitted
[04/09/2025, 15.14.16] Yousif Zaid: Ayyy you did it
[04/09/2025, 15.14.31] Yousif Zaid: Must have just been a sign error or maybe some arithmetic

[04/09/2025, 15.15.39] Ems : image omitted
[04/09/2025, 15.15.52] Ems : I'm still mad
[04/09/2025, 15.16.03] Yousif Zaid: I won’t do it because I’m a changed man
[04/09/2025, 15.16.09] Ems : Mmmh
[04/09/2025, 15.16.14] Yousif Zaid: It is a nice photo and we will leave it that way
[04/09/2025, 15.16.23] Ems : This is your test
[04/09/2025, 15.16.29] Ems : I know the temptation is high
[04/09/2025, 15.16.36] Yousif Zaid: It’s not there
[04/09/2025, 15.16.58] Yousif Zaid: For I am changed. No man can walk through the same river twice, for the river is not the same, and he would not be the same man
[04/09/2025, 15.17.32] Ems : Ok Heraclitus
[04/09/2025, 15.17.37] Ems : Yeah I bet

[04/09/2025, 15.52.47] Ems : image omitted
[04/09/2025, 15.53.00] Yousif Zaid: !!!!!!!
[04/09/2025, 15.53.28] Yousif Zaid: I would do a war cry and take a photo but I’d scare the ppl I’m sharing an office with
[04/09/2025, 15.53.38] Ems : I can't believe everything is still there

[04/09/2025, 15.57.41] Ems : I had lost all hope I'm so relieved
[04/09/2025, 15.58.04] Yousif Zaid: The bastards at DTU never reimbursed me for the 650 I paid to have a work phone fixed
[04/09/2025, 15.58.06] Yousif Zaid: I just noticed
[04/09/2025, 15.58.16] Yousif Zaid: Help me think of what to yell at them when I walk in
[04/09/2025, 16.15.14] Yousif Zaid: This is embarrassing they sent me the money I just didn’t see

[04/09/2025, 21.57.22] Yousif Zaid: i'm just traumatised from growing up watching danish kids whip these out their lunchboxes. its just bread and shrimp + shrimpwater from the container.

[04/09/2025, 22.01.26] Yousif Zaid: i'm really just shitting on the danish lunch box way of eating these foods
[04/09/2025, 22.02.15] Yousif Zaid: like a hot summer day and little Niels whips this out his metal lunchbox
[04/09/2025, 22.02.20] Ems : HAHAHAJAJAHAHA

[04/09/2025, 22.15.57] Ems : You just hate rye bread at this point
[04/09/2025, 22.16.07] Yousif Zaid: WHY THE FUCK WOULD ANYONE SIT DOWN AND MAKE THIS

[04/09/2025, 22.23.17] Ems : It's funny
[04/09/2025, 22.23.25] Yousif Zaid: at lunch today. you grabbed the chicken stew and no noodles. maybe you weren't hungry enough for both. why grab only stew and not only noodle?
[04/09/2025, 22.23.53] Yousif Zaid: cuz just noodles taste like nothing. to me. the potato open faced sandwich represents just grabbing the noodles
[04/09/2025, 22.24.23] Yousif Zaid: im falling for the rage-bait this is embarassing
[04/09/2025, 22.24.32] Ems : I didn't think you'd noticed hahahaha

[04/09/2025, 22.26.12] Yousif Zaid: i have the passport and love stjerneskud and tartelletter and æbleskiver and speak the language and you can go fuck yourself
[04/09/2025, 22.26.17] Yousif Zaid: i am calm
[04/09/2025, 22.26.22] Yousif Zaid: and do not draw dots on your forehead anymore
[04/09/2025, 22.26.23] Ems : No the all caps texts on smørrebrod say otherwise
[04/09/2025, 22.27.02] Yousif Zaid: i'll admit to losing this argument the day i sit down and watch you eat a potato sandwich

[04/09/2025, 22.28.37] Ems : I've never eaten one of these I think
[04/09/2025, 22.28.46] Ems : Fish and chips is the way to go

[06/09/2025, 19.46.27] Yousif Zaid: A little too sweet
[06/09/2025, 19.47.00] Yousif Zaid: Clung to the sides of the bottle like a high percentage wine

[06/09/2025, 20.29.49] Ems : Literally almost

[06/09/2025, 20.37.07] Yousif Zaid: On second thought watching me eat a rotisserie chicken might not be so charming actually
[06/09/2025, 20.37.39] Ems : Ehm that sounds like the kind of place that I would absolutely want to go to
[06/09/2025, 20.38.05] Yousif Zaid: It’s so cheap too!
[06/09/2025, 20.38.23] Ems : Yousif by the way, do you want to go to Dragsholm castle on the evening of the 14th? Or is that day not good?
[06/09/2025, 20.38.47] Yousif Zaid: I’ll make the reservation
[06/09/2025, 20.39.03] Yousif Zaid: Isn’t your family there though?
[06/09/2025, 20.39.19] Ems : They go before lunch on the 14th
[06/09/2025, 20.39.34] Ems : We can do 15th if it's easier
[06/09/2025, 20.40.01] Yousif Zaid: I have nothing planned on either day, no reason why we shouldn’t do it on the weekend, 14th then?
[06/09/2025, 20.41.07] Ems : Perfect
[06/09/2025, 20.41.25] Yousif Zaid: I’ll call the castle people
[06/09/2025, 20.48.22] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/09/2025, 20.50.32] Ems : Awww
[06/09/2025, 20.50.37] Ems : Vitamin c is there
[06/09/2025, 20.50.40] Ems : So that's good
[06/09/2025, 20.50.47] Yousif Zaid: How can we not have apples
[06/09/2025, 20.51.01] Ems : It's cause you gave two to me
[06/09/2025, 20.51.07] Ems : Delicious by the way
[06/09/2025, 20.51.14] Yousif Zaid: Even the second one?
[06/09/2025, 20.51.33] Ems : I haven't gotten to that yet
[06/09/2025, 20.51.54] Yousif Zaid: Yes that’s why. I went back to my parents house and grabbed the last apple out the fridge so you could have it. I’m a diagnosed psychopath
[06/09/2025, 20.57.36] Ems : Ok no reason to get upset
[06/09/2025, 20.57.48] Ems : If that was a text from me you'd say meow
[06/09/2025, 20.58.04] Yousif Zaid: It was meant to be funny just say meow and keep it moving
[06/09/2025, 20.58.51] Ems : I know it was, this is a very normal text
[06/09/2025, 20.59.00] Ems : Read it in a funny tone not angry
[06/09/2025, 20.59.16] Yousif Zaid: Yay
[06/09/2025, 21.02.19] Yousif Zaid: You’re very slow about eating apples. I just go weeks without eating fruit and then eat 7 apples in one morning
[06/09/2025, 21.08.46] Yousif Zaid: btw i discovered this italian music duo Nu Genea and i think they're fantastic, do you know them?
[06/09/2025, 21.12.35] Ems : It's called consistency. I do multiple fruits at once as well, like this morning it was mango frozen berries and some apple
[06/09/2025, 21.12.44] Ems : Actually no I'll give them a listen
[06/09/2025, 21.13.03] Yousif Zaid: they're neopolitan
[06/09/2025, 21.13.46] Yousif Zaid: their songs are in french/neopolitan. so far my favourite song is called "Marechià" which i think is neopolitan for mergellina? some part of the coast of naples?
[06/09/2025, 21.14.33] Ems : Ok it sounds very interesting
[06/09/2025, 21.14.41] Yousif Zaid: its a peak summer song
[06/09/2025, 21.14.52] Ems : Literally it means like clear sea
[06/09/2025, 21.15.23] Yousif Zaid: ahhh ok. google told me it was also referring to that place but it could be bullshit
[06/09/2025, 21.15.36] Yousif Zaid: people talked so much shit about neopolitan music when i was over there, but this stuff is great
[06/09/2025, 21.18.03] Ems : No Google is probably right I don't claim to know more than it
[06/09/2025, 21.18.20] Ems : Ok first of all people must be claudio
[06/09/2025, 21.18.47] Ems : But yeah in general it's not considered great, at least the new stuff
[06/09/2025, 21.20.26] Yousif Zaid: it was also you guys too if i remember correct? also his scouts didnt like it
[06/09/2025, 21.21.08] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[06/09/2025, 21.26.23] Ems : I know a kind of good song
[06/09/2025, 21.26.30] Ems : And the old ones are really good
[06/09/2025, 21.26.43] Ems : Oh this is really great you're right
[06/09/2025, 21.27.03] Ems : Ohh remind me I have to tell you something really funny
[06/09/2025, 21.27.19] Ems : It has to be in person because I have to demonstrate something
[06/09/2025, 21.27.35] Yousif Zaid: dear god i hope its not similar to my demonstration when i said this to you
[06/09/2025, 21.27.50] Ems : No fascism is involved
[06/09/2025, 21.27.58] Ems : It's infinitely more cringy
[06/09/2025, 21.27.58] Yousif Zaid: well that's something
[06/09/2025, 21.28.14] Yousif Zaid: on the same level as "pretend to dribble a basketball as you walk past us"
[06/09/2025, 21.28.26] Ems : I would say so
[06/09/2025, 21.28.37] Ems : Maybe not as douchy
[06/09/2025, 21.28.37] Yousif Zaid: oh my god
[06/09/2025, 21.28.44] Yousif Zaid: okay okay. monday
[07/09/2025, 12.20.57] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[07/09/2025, 12.21.07] Yousif Zaid: Taking care of the girl. This is fun I’ve never done this before
[07/09/2025, 12.30.13] Ems : Hahahahahahha I've actually never done it
[07/09/2025, 12.30.19] Ems : I usually do it at home
[07/09/2025, 12.30.29] Yousif Zaid: Me too but I wanted to try something new
[07/09/2025, 12.30.36] Ems : That looks like a water park
[07/09/2025, 12.30.45] Ems : How's she lookin
[07/09/2025, 12.30.53] Yousif Zaid: I’ve not even been on my phone in here I’m just staring at the cool machine
[07/09/2025, 12.31.25] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/09/2025, 12.31.26] Ems : It looks fun I have to say
[07/09/2025, 12.31.42] Ems : How long does it take?
[07/09/2025, 12.31.46] Yousif Zaid: It would actually be fun to take someone in here and just listen to music
[07/09/2025, 12.31.47] Ems : Like 10 mins?
[07/09/2025, 12.31.56] Yousif Zaid: 15, I paid for the nice one
[07/09/2025, 12.32.03] Ems : So fancy
[07/09/2025, 12.32.25] Ems : She now makes noise every time she arrives but at least she looks pretty
[07/09/2025, 12.32.31] Ems : That's what you thought
[07/09/2025, 12.32.58] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[07/09/2025, 12.34.52] Ems : What do you mean it looks good from here
[07/09/2025, 12.34.59] Ems : Yeah maybe not that
[07/09/2025, 12.37.21] Yousif Zaid: She’s past her prime I think. A bath won’t change that [07/09/2025, 12.37.23] Yousif Zaid: I love her still
[07/09/2025, 12.40.47] Ems : She's perfect
[07/09/2025, 12.41.29] Ems : There's no "past her prime" for our cars honestly. The older they get the more admirable they become
[07/09/2025, 12.41.47] Yousif Zaid: That’s true. Until they start burning a hole in your wallet
[07/09/2025, 12.42.02] Yousif Zaid: 9000 dkk to keep her from making farting noises everywhere we go
[07/09/2025, 12.42.14] Yousif Zaid: What are you up to?
[07/09/2025, 12.43.34] Ems : Yeah..
[07/09/2025, 12.43.41] Ems : Genetics notes now
[07/09/2025, 12.43.49] Ems : image omitted
[07/09/2025, 12.43.57] Ems : But I went for such a nice walk earlier
[07/09/2025, 12.44.02] Ems : It's so nice outside
[07/09/2025, 12.44.05] Yousif Zaid: Meiosis
[07/09/2025, 12.44.33] Yousif Zaid: It is! My parents and I will go on a little boat. Either a canoe or a rowboat, but the main idea is I do all the work
[07/09/2025, 12.44.42] Ems : Last week's stuff
[07/09/2025, 12.44.49] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
[07/09/2025, 12.44.54] Ems : Where
[07/09/2025, 12.45.02] Yousif Zaid: Lyngby lake
[07/09/2025, 12.45.20] Yousif Zaid: Actually the bridge where we smoked and a swan nearly bit you on the butt is one of the “stops”
[07/09/2025, 12.46.46] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been there before and it’s so beautiful we should go one day
[07/09/2025, 12.50.39] Ems : That sounds beautiful
[07/09/2025, 12.50.42] Ems : Send pictures
[07/09/2025, 12.50.51] Ems : Are you guys going now or afternoon?
[07/09/2025, 12.51.12] Yousif Zaid: I’m not sure, planning things out with my parents is always touch and go
[07/09/2025, 12.51.33] Yousif Zaid: I’m not sure if I can make it to Nordhavn with you guys
[07/09/2025, 12.55.53] Ems : I'm actually still deciding whether to go, I have to do some work and some cleaning
[07/09/2025, 12.56.06] Ems : It is a really nice day though so I'm considering
[07/09/2025, 12.56.54] Yousif Zaid: If neither of us end up going maybe we can make up for it with a small evening walk when I get back to DTU later
[07/09/2025, 14.39.27] Ems : Sure

[07/09/2025, 16.34.32] Yousif Zaid: Did you end up going to nordhavn?
[07/09/2025, 16.53.36] Ems : No Marta and I decided it got a bit late and we couldn't be bothered
[07/09/2025, 16.54.19] Yousif Zaid: Are you two becoming besties?
[07/09/2025, 16.54.59] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[07/09/2025, 16.55.10] Yousif Zaid: I’m not even joking
[07/09/2025, 16.55.19] Ems : We were talking about it yesterday that's why I'm talking in plural
[07/09/2025, 16.55.22] Yousif Zaid: I like the duo, she seems very wholesome
[07/09/2025, 16.55.26] Ems : I know that's why it's funny
[07/09/2025, 16.55.43] Yousif Zaid: Sitting in the park together

[07/09/2025, 16.58.10] Ems : Good for him
[07/09/2025, 16.58.19] Ems : Are you a life coach now
[07/09/2025, 16.58.38] Yousif Zaid: I just think it’s embarrassing my 17 year old brother shits himself at the sight of a moth
[07/09/2025, 16.58.41] Yousif Zaid: Or a bumblebee
[07/09/2025, 17.07.29] Ems : You shit yourself at the sight of coffee
[07/09/2025, 17.07.41] Ems : It's debatable which one is more embarrassing
[07/09/2025, 17.08.00] Yousif Zaid: I am zen. This is rage bait
[07/09/2025, 17.08.38] Yousif Zaid: It’s very funny rage bait.
[07/09/2025, 17.10.57] Ems : Come on you were insulting him for a phobia
[07/09/2025, 17.11.04] Ems : But well done for curing it
[07/09/2025, 17.11.27] Yousif Zaid: Bumble bees?
[07/09/2025, 17.11.51] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[07/09/2025, 17.14.27] Ems : I kind of love them I can't lie

[07/09/2025, 17.14.49] Yousif Zaid: Them, and praying mantises
[07/09/2025, 17.16.53] Yousif Zaid: Do you like bird watching?
[07/09/2025, 17.25.43] Ems : A normal amount I think
[07/09/2025, 17.25.51] Ems : I enjoy seeing them
[07/09/2025, 17.25.58] Yousif Zaid: I’ve made fun of every bird watcher I’ve ever seen
[07/09/2025, 17.26.10] Yousif Zaid: Want to go to a bird watching spot with me later tonight? Just for a short bit, the spot is nothing that crazy [07/09/2025, 17.35.59] Ems : What time are you thinking?
[07/09/2025, 17.36.04] Ems : It's the binoculars
[07/09/2025, 17.36.45] Yousif Zaid: Dinner is ready in an hour for me, then I eat and I’m free for the rest of the day
[07/09/2025, 17.37.06] Yousif Zaid: The telescopes too. Saw a guy whip one out and I nearly laughed in his face
[07/09/2025, 17.37.50] Yousif Zaid: Even later in the day is fine, sunset should still be nice
[07/09/2025, 17.55.52] Ems : Are you in lynby or home for dinner?

[07/09/2025, 17.57.05] Ems : 7.45?
[07/09/2025, 17.57.16] Yousif Zaid: I’ll be there
[07/09/2025, 17.57.32] Ems : I know it's specific, 7.30 felt too early and 8 too late
[07/09/2025, 17.57.37] Ems : Actually we can do 8
[07/09/2025, 17.58.07] Yousif Zaid: Can we do 7:45 actually? I was just thinking I could use exactly 15 more minutes of sleep tonight
[07/09/2025, 17.58.13] Yousif Zaid: It’s important to me
[07/09/2025, 17.58.25] Ems : [07/09/2025, 17.58.37] Yousif Zaid: I’ll be at yours 8
[07/09/2025, 17.58.53] Yousif Zaid: I can go without the 15. Just this once though
[07/09/2025, 17.59.06] Ems : No you should get your beauty sleep god forbid it's 15 minutes less
[07/09/2025, 17.59.41] Yousif Zaid: There’s an Iraqi joke about beauty sleep where you’d reply “Beauty sleep??!! God didn’t make you beautiful how is sleep gonna do it”
[07/09/2025, 18.05.04] Ems : Harsh but fair
[07/09/2025, 20.01.34] Ems : Just text when you're almost here
[07/09/2025, 22.45.54] Yousif Zaid: Thanks for tonight, sorry for keeping you, goodnight ems
[07/09/2025, 23.02.54] Ems : Night yuyu, don't be sorry I had a really good time
[08/09/2025, 06.56.17] Yousif Zaid: For the love of god tell me you didn’t wake up with a sore throat
[08/09/2025, 07.04.07] Ems : Actually no, I thankfully had a jacket and we split all cigarettes so I'm perfectly fine
[08/09/2025, 07.05.05] Yousif Zaid: Thank god, I felt a bit “eh” last night before sleeping and I’ve woken up with a sore throat, so I think I’m a bit sick
[08/09/2025, 07.05.12] Yousif Zaid: I was afraid I had made you sick
[08/09/2025, 07.05.42] Ems : If anything I'll feel it tomorrow then hahahahah
[08/09/2025, 07.05.45] Ems : We'll see

[08/09/2025, 13.49.09] Ems : Did they already talk about the other types of sequencing?
[08/09/2025, 13.49.20] Yousif Zaid: There’s other types of sequencing?
[08/09/2025, 13.49.20] Ems : You ask Claude when the lesson is done
[08/09/2025, 13.49.29] Yousif Zaid: Ohhh man I’m fried

[08/09/2025, 13.50.51] Ems : DNA Sequencing DNA Sequencing Methods: A Clear Explanation
The Challenge Before the 1970s
Before the mid-1970s, scientists couldn't directly read DNA sequences. They had to use "reverse genetics" - working backwards from protein sequences to guess the DNA code. This was difficult because multiple DNA sequences can code for the same protein.
Two Revolutionary Methods (Mid-1970s)
1. Maxam-Gilbert Method (Chemical Cleavage)
How it works:
•	Uses chemicals to selectively break DNA at specific bases
•	DNA is radioactively labeled at one end
•	Four separate chemical reactions target different bases:
•	Dimethyl sulfate + piperidine → cuts at G only
•	Dimethyl sulfate + piperidine + formic acid → cuts at G and A
•	Hydrazine + piperidine → cuts at T and C
•	Hydrazine + piperidine + salt → cuts at C only
The process:
1.	Split labeled DNA into four tubes
2.	Apply different chemical treatments to each tube
3.	Run fragments on gel (smaller pieces travel farther)
4.	Use X-ray film to detect radioactive fragments
5.	Read sequence from bottom to top of the film
Results: 200-300 bases every few days, but required dangerous chemicals and radioactive materials.
2. Sanger Method (Chain Termination)
Key insight: Uses modified DNA building blocks that stop chain growth.
The chemistry:
•	Normal DNA uses deoxyribose sugar (has -OH group on 3' carbon)
•	Sanger used dideoxyribose (missing -OH on both 2' and 3' carbons)
•	When a dideoxy nucleotide gets incorporated, DNA synthesis stops
The process:
1.	Four separate reactions, each with one type of chain-terminating nucleotide
2.	DNA polymerase builds new strands until it hits a terminator
3.	Creates fragments of all possible lengths ending in specific bases
4.	Run on gel and read sequence
Advantages: Safer chemicals, more efficient (2-3x faster than Maxam-Gilbert)
The Automation Revolution (1980s-1990s)
Fluorescent Labeling (1986)
Innovation: Replaced radioactive labels with fluorescent dyes
•	Four different colored dyes for the four DNA bases
•	Laser excites the dyes, detector reads the colors
•	Computer automatically calls the bases
•	All reactions can be run in a single tube/lane
Improved Dye Chemistry
Scientists developed better fluorescent dyes:
•	First: Succinylfluorescein dyes (SF505, SF512, SF519, SF526)
•	Later: Rhodamine derivatives for better detection
•	Each base gets a unique color signature
Capillary Electrophoresis (Early 1990s)
The breakthrough: Replaced large gel slabs with tiny glass capillaries
Advantages:
•	Much faster (higher voltages possible due to better heat dissipation)
•	Fully automated (no manual gel pouring or handling)
•	Reusable (polymer can be flushed out and replaced)
•	Higher throughput
How it works:
1.	DNA sequencing reaction prepared in a tube
2.	Automated system loads sample into capillary filled with polymer
3.	Electric current separates fragments by size
4.	Laser excites fluorescent terminators as they pass detection window
5.	Computer reads color signals and determines sequence
6.	Output: 500-1000 high-quality bases in a few hours
Key Scientific Discoveries
The development of these sequencing methods led to major discoveries:
•	Introns and Exons: Found that eukaryotic genes have non-coding regions (introns) interrupted by coding regions (exons)
•	GT/AG Rule: Discovered that introns typically start with GT and end with AG
•	GenBank: Led to the first DNA sequence database in 1979
The Evolution Summary
1.	1970s: Manual, dangerous, slow (200-300 bases/few days)
2.	1980s: Automated detection, safer, faster
3.	1990s: Capillary systems, high throughput (500-1000 bases/few hours)
4.	Modern: Foundation for genome projects and personalized medicine
This progression from chemical methods to automated fluorescent detection made large-scale genome sequencing projects possible, including the Human Genome Project.

[09/09/2025, 15.58.31] Yousif Zaid: I just tried calling a wastewater treatment facility to ask for samples but it turned out to be a mental asylum that had their own water treatment plant for their 40 full time patients. Totally reminded me of the mental hospital from Norwegian wood
[09/09/2025, 15.58.51] Yousif Zaid: The lady said “you can have the phone number of our janitor if you like” this is not going to work out
[09/09/2025, 16.20.36] Ems : I can just imagine naoko
[09/09/2025, 16.20.40] Ems : It's really not

[09/09/2025, 16.56.00] Ems : Up for debate
[09/09/2025, 16.56.15] Yousif Zaid: Show stopping
[09/09/2025, 16.58.00] Yousif Zaid: What are you up to now?

[09/09/2025, 17.04.30] Yousif Zaid: Copying down physics notes nicely, then doing math exercises. I’ll do dinner tonight (no plans for this yet), then try and make sense of this bio shit afterwards. I’m completely fried with regards to that
[09/09/2025, 17.04.52] Yousif Zaid: I think it’s sadly going to rain on Sunday
[09/09/2025, 17.07.55] Ems : What's the bio topic? Maybe I can find smt useful
[09/09/2025, 17.08.14] Ems : It's still really far away I bet you anything the weather's going to change
[09/09/2025, 17.08.16] Yousif Zaid: Darling I don’t even know
[09/09/2025, 17.08.31] Ems : Oh ok

[09/09/2025, 17.08.39] Yousif Zaid: In regards to the subject of bio, I will be optimistic about the weather with you
[09/09/2025, 17.08.50] Ems : Sounds good!!
[09/09/2025, 17.08.59] Yousif Zaid: I guess I can tell you when I find out?
[09/09/2025, 17.09.04] Ems : (you should probably figure it out)
[09/09/2025, 17.09.11] Yousif Zaid: How biological systems process information
[09/09/2025, 17.09.21] Yousif Zaid: DNA makes proteins and all that

[09/09/2025, 17.21.40] Yousif Zaid: Think about what you’re saying. Why would I make potatoes AND rice
[09/09/2025, 17.21.58] Ems : I think you thought it wasn't enough
[09/09/2025, 17.22.08] Ems : It was me you Claudio dimi and jaap

[09/09/2025, 17.23.01] Yousif Zaid: I know I just have a hard time leaving you be, it would drag on
[09/09/2025, 17.25.36] Yousif Zaid: Maybe if we are disciplined
[09/09/2025, 17.26.19] Ems : Are you talking about your place or my place?
[09/09/2025, 17.26.51] Yousif Zaid: It can be at mine if you prefer, then we include Claudio
[09/09/2025, 17.29.27] Yousif Zaid: That might actually force us to not spend too much time cosy’ing up if we have to work

[11/09/2025, 10.28.43] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
[11/09/2025, 10.43.02] Ems : I think I was just dumb yesterday
[11/09/2025, 10.43.10] Ems : This isn't as hard as I remembered it
[11/09/2025, 10.43.36] Yousif Zaid: You were dehydrated
[11/09/2025, 10.43.56] Yousif Zaid: I have a friend named Abid Abdi Azzizi and it’s like. Nobody is that Middle Eastern man

[11/09/2025, 11.23.52] Ems : Of course
[11/09/2025, 11.24.00] Ems : I never expected those sandwiches to

[11/09/2025, 11.42.51] Ems : I kind of wiped it first...
[11/09/2025, 11.43.08] Yousif Zaid: And you didn’t even let me see you take them off yesterday
[11/09/2025, 11.49.14] Ems : It's not like I REALLY wanted to shake his hand right there
[11/09/2025, 11.49.26] Ems : He seemed happy to introduce himself at least
[11/09/2025, 11.49.26] Yousif Zaid: Mhm
[11/09/2025, 11.49.47] Ems : You don't want to see me take them off
[11/09/2025, 11.50.14] Yousif Zaid: Would you be surprised to learn that I do?
[11/09/2025, 12.03.59] Ems : Yes
[11/09/2025, 12.04.25] Ems : Is it cause you're curious or because it's funny
[11/09/2025, 12.07.12] Yousif Zaid: Neither, I just think it would be cute
[11/09/2025, 12.19.58] Yousif Zaid: I came by to quickly say hi but you aren’t here anymore
[11/09/2025, 12.22.30] Ems : I was there 20 mins before
[11/09/2025, 12.22.42] Ems : Ok maybe
[11/09/2025, 12.22.51] Ems : Maybe one day
[11/09/2025, 12.23.36] Yousif Zaid: They’re having some event at the library about getting a job without speaking Danish
[11/09/2025, 12.24.47] Ems : It's because I wasn't with Marta so I went home for lunch
[11/09/2025, 12.24.54] Ems : My kind of thing
[11/09/2025, 12.25.15] Yousif Zaid: I told the old dude henrik that I put this up with about you and he got excited and said “if you two are ever in helsingor text me and you come over for tea with me and my wife”
[11/09/2025, 12.26.27] Yousif Zaid: I doubt it would ever happen, might be awkward but the thought is cute
[11/09/2025, 12.29.36] Ems : The thought is lovely
[11/09/2025, 12.29.45] Ems : If we ever are there we're going

[11/09/2025, 14.48.41] Ems : Also lovely cup
[11/09/2025, 14.48.51] Ems : I just finished in the lab it was so so fun
[11/09/2025, 14.50.17] Yousif Zaid: Tell me about it?
[11/09/2025, 14.50.39] Yousif Zaid: Mint green. I sent the photo cuz of the cup. The cup looks vaguely Middle Eastern
[11/09/2025, 14.50.56] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know but Han Sun is so real for putting the cat as the background
[11/09/2025, 15.05.57] Ems : audio omitted
[11/09/2025, 15.06.47] Ems : Yeah he is, I am kind of worried for the cat
[11/09/2025, 15.07.40] Yousif Zaid: You should be a radio host
[11/09/2025, 15.08.02] Yousif Zaid: It’s always fun to put on a lab coat
[11/09/2025, 15.08.46] Yousif Zaid: Do you have exercises til 5 after the labs? Did you touch the pipette to the plastic bag containing the pipettes? That’s bad I’ve heard
[11/09/2025, 15.09.24] Yousif Zaid: I’ve been pretending to work all day. I finished the multiple choice question for the weekly math stuff and I did the first question on the mobius.
[11/09/2025, 15.09.57] Yousif Zaid: Listening to some Tárrega [11/09/2025, 15.18.53] Ems : I'm not sure people would appreciate
[11/09/2025, 15.18.57] Ems : Exactly
[11/09/2025, 15.19.11] Ems : No I'm home now getting ready for tomorrow
[11/09/2025, 15.19.30] Ems : I was extra careful not to touch the bag, that would be a rookie mistake
[11/09/2025, 15.19.54] Ems : How was the MC? I still have to do that
[11/09/2025, 15.19.58] Yousif Zaid: It would just be for me, I like hearing you talk
[11/09/2025, 15.20.01] Yousif Zaid: Piss easy

[11/09/2025, 15.22.43] Ems : My mom asked me to pack some stuff for her
[11/09/2025, 15.22.48] Ems : And I have to pack for myself
[11/09/2025, 15.23.30] Yousif Zaid: I’m not very smart why should you pack stuff for her? Isn’t she coming to you?
[11/09/2025, 15.23.50] Yousif Zaid: Pack for yourself? Are yall going somewhere?
[11/09/2025, 15.24.12] Yousif Zaid: Ah it should be fine. Sets and functions is easy

[11/09/2025, 15.28.16] Yousif Zaid: Please thank her for me
[11/09/2025, 15.28.32] Yousif Zaid: There’s a word missing here or I can’t read
[11/09/2025, 15.30.09] Ems : That's right

[11/09/2025, 15.34.29] Ems : image omitted
[11/09/2025, 15.34.43] Ems : It might be THE best drink I've ever made
[11/09/2025, 15.35.16] Yousif Zaid: The barmaid will have to remake it for me one day
[11/09/2025, 15.36.32] Yousif Zaid: The coast of Espergærde is pretty, in my opinion
[11/09/2025, 15.37.11] Ems : You know how much I enjoy it

[11/09/2025, 15.38.06] Yousif Zaid: I’m not so confident about it
[11/09/2025, 15.38.41] Yousif Zaid: My actual advice would be to drive directly to the coast and cruise all the way up north, and stopping at any place that catches your fancy
[11/09/2025, 15.40.09] Ems : Okok
[11/09/2025, 15.40.17] Ems : I reported both things

[11/09/2025, 20.01.17] Ems : More like a BBQ but whatever
[11/09/2025, 20.01.39] Yousif Zaid: yeah but its probably bad etiquette to cuddle the birthday girl infront of everyone
[11/09/2025, 20.02.28] Ems : In general it depends how drunk the people are but you're probably right
[11/09/2025, 20.02.47] Yousif Zaid: do you know chet baker?
[11/09/2025, 20.03.21] Ems : I know who he is but not well

[11/09/2025, 20.05.52] Yousif Zaid: probably
[11/09/2025, 20.06.15] Yousif Zaid: I would tell you to listen to all of "chet baker sings" but that's a very annoyying reccommendation to make
[11/09/2025, 20.06.23] Yousif Zaid: its like 45 minutes long
[11/09/2025, 20.06.24] Ems : It was really nice, you were so embarrassed to listen to it
[11/09/2025, 20.06.35] Ems : You shouldn't have been
[11/09/2025, 20.06.41] Yousif Zaid: the sound of my own speaking voice is like glass in my ears, much less singing
[11/09/2025, 20.07.05] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[11/09/2025, 20.07.32] Ems : You literally ran out of the room

[11/09/2025, 20.11.00] Yousif Zaid: the tone is keeping it funny so ppl dont think you hit me when its just us two
[11/09/2025, 20.11.08] Yousif Zaid: its for your sake

[11/09/2025, 20.12.01] Yousif Zaid: dead serious "yes dear" = she's throwing furniture at him
[11/09/2025, 20.12.29] Ems : Actually yes

[11/09/2025, 20.21.03] Ems : Ok if you really insist I won't say anything
[11/09/2025, 20.21.16] Yousif Zaid: well i want to actually do it so saying something would ruin the suprise

[13/09/2025, 17.06.47] Yousif Zaid: I am not made for this anymore I ate it and feel sick to my stomach
[13/09/2025, 17.06.53] Yousif Zaid: Maybe my days of being a real eater are over
[13/09/2025, 17.40.03] Ems : Maybe I should rethink thanking you to all you can eat sushi
[13/09/2025, 17.40.10] Ems : I need real eaters you know
[13/09/2025, 17.41.22] Ems : image omitted

[13/09/2025, 20.35.24] Ems : Don't text and drive yuyu
[13/09/2025, 20.35.45] Yousif Zaid: Girl I’m falling asleep in the backseat
[13/09/2025, 20.36.27] Yousif Zaid: Way too wrecked to drive home. I think we got up at like 5:45 am together this morning
[13/09/2025, 20.44.31] Ems : I know I'm shattered
[13/09/2025, 20.44.58] Yousif Zaid: Was real nice though : )
[13/09/2025, 20.45.36] Ems : Yeah I'm not complaining
[13/09/2025, 20.45.44] Ems : I will tell you something though

[13/09/2025, 20.47.14] Yousif Zaid: Yeah that looks crazy good. I ate terribly today. Way too much Costco food. I think I ate enough chemicals for a year [13/09/2025, 21.38.52] Ems : image omitted

[13/09/2025, 21.40.10] Ems : So fucking good
[13/09/2025, 21.40.47] Yousif Zaid: Sometimes you see a meal laid out and you can tell a lot about the people eating it
[13/09/2025, 21.41.41] Yousif Zaid: Good fucking idea
[13/09/2025, 21.41.49] Ems : Elaborate
[13/09/2025, 21.42.24] Ems : The cold took my appetite away, I'm going to push through for dessert
[13/09/2025, 21.43.11] Yousif Zaid: Maybe it’s not that deep but it’s very charming and quaint. Like it gives the impression that you guys are “flink” is the word in Danish. Pleasant? Unsure about the translation. Especially that you cooked it yourselves instead of going out to eat
[13/09/2025, 21.43.53] Yousif Zaid: This feels like it’s my fault. What’s for dessert
[13/09/2025, 21.55.18] Ems : Yeah I love dinners like these, everyone just contributes and it's very cozy
[13/09/2025, 21.55.33] Ems : Leftover cake and weird flavours of ice cream that I cose
[13/09/2025, 21.55.37] Ems : Chose*
[13/09/2025, 21.55.42] Ems : You would never guess
[13/09/2025, 21.56.11] Ems : One is flødeboller and the other one is raspberry and liquorice
[13/09/2025, 21.56.13] Ems : Like
[13/09/2025, 21.56.16] Ems : I'm so curious
[13/09/2025, 21.57.31] Yousif Zaid: Maybe I’ve lived here so long but I see these all the time? I’ve never tried them though
[13/09/2025, 21.57.34] Yousif Zaid: You’ll have to let me know
[13/09/2025, 22.18.04] Yousif Zaid: Also, the earliest reservation possible at dragsholm is at 17:30, so that’s when we have ours
[13/09/2025, 23.36.51] Ems : They were really good, especially the raspberry one
[13/09/2025, 23.36.56] Ems : That's perfect
[13/09/2025, 23.37.12] Ems : The gifts were amazing I'll show them to you tomorrow
[13/09/2025, 23.38.22] Yousif Zaid: I’m looking forward to it
[13/09/2025, 23.38.46] Yousif Zaid: Besides diner, what would you like to do tommorow?
[13/09/2025, 23.38.58] Yousif Zaid: If anything, I know you’re a busy lady
[13/09/2025, 23.43.56] Ems : I'm considering the movie, it would be really fun
[13/09/2025, 23.44.05] Ems : We could also take a nice walk on the beach
[13/09/2025, 23.44.11] Ems : What do you think?
[13/09/2025, 23.44.30] Yousif Zaid: I think the nice walk on the beach is weather dependent
[13/09/2025, 23.44.41] Ems : True
[13/09/2025, 23.45.14] Yousif Zaid: The rain should be less bad at around 5 actually
[13/09/2025, 23.45.37] Yousif Zaid: If you do want to do something else, would you want it to be before or after dinner?
[13/09/2025, 23.47.23] Ems : Maybe before
[13/09/2025, 23.47.43] Yousif Zaid: Apartment is empty before, throwing that out there
[13/09/2025, 23.47.48] Yousif Zaid: There’s a tv
[13/09/2025, 23.48.53] Ems : Ok if the weather allows it, walk on the beach would be really nice, otherwise this is a very good plan as well
[13/09/2025, 23.49.16] Yousif Zaid: It’s a bit of a conundrum
[13/09/2025, 23.49.34] Yousif Zaid: When you say walk on the beach you mean near dragsholm?
[13/09/2025, 23.49.47] Ems : Yeah
[13/09/2025, 23.50.00] Ems : I don't even know if it's possible it's just a thought
[13/09/2025, 23.50.12] Yousif Zaid: The coast is nice near Dragsholm
[13/09/2025, 23.50.40] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted
[13/09/2025, 23.51.32] Yousif Zaid: Like I’m not sure how you’re imagining this
[13/09/2025, 23.51.54] Ems : Ok then maybe we just do that after dinner if it's nice
[13/09/2025, 23.52.11] Ems : audio omitted
[13/09/2025, 23.52.26] Yousif Zaid: Yeah! The castle estate is not so large we have time to meander down to the coast
[13/09/2025, 23.52.37] Yousif Zaid: I believe it’s an 8 minute drive if I remember right, it’s beautiful
[13/09/2025, 23.52.55] Yousif Zaid: Up to the coast *
[13/09/2025, 23.53.58] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/09/2025, 23.54.30] Yousif Zaid: When would you like to meet?
[13/09/2025, 23.58.14] Ems : It's about an hour's drive right?
[13/09/2025, 23.58.33] Ems : I'm thinking to see if there's actually time to watch a movie before
[13/09/2025, 23.59.11] Yousif Zaid: Hour and 4 min from apartment
[13/09/2025, 23.59.30] Yousif Zaid: Which means we would leave Lundo at 4:20
[14/09/2025, 00.00.04] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted
[14/09/2025, 00.01.30] Ems : [14/09/2025, 00.01.55] Yousif Zaid: Happy birthday!

[14/09/2025, 00.02.48] Yousif Zaid: Was dating a teenager for exactly 6 days
[14/09/2025, 00.03.28] Ems : How did it feel? Being a whole two years older

[14/09/2025, 00.07.58] Ems : If I say bullshit it's because of this
[14/09/2025, 00.07.59] Yousif Zaid: How will you survive
[14/09/2025, 00.08.28] Ems : I'm honestly not sure

[14/09/2025, 00.08.39] Yousif Zaid: Can I show you something really embarrassing
[14/09/2025, 00.08.53] Ems : Of course
[14/09/2025, 00.09.01] Yousif Zaid: I thought to send you the happy birthday thing literally 4 minutes before midnight and I was in bed
[14/09/2025, 00.09.28] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[14/09/2025, 08.59.37] Ems : I'm sorry but I'm not feeling too well, mom says I have a fever
[14/09/2025, 09.48.44] Yousif Zaid: Awh how are you feeling? What’s wrong ems?

[14/09/2025, 10.15.43] Yousif Zaid: My dad would be making you all sorts of concoctions
[14/09/2025, 10.16.41] Yousif Zaid: He mixes up all sorts of stuff that he swears will cure anything

[14/09/2025, 10.43.20] Yousif Zaid: Some people just have names where you know they’ll do cool stuff
[14/09/2025, 10.43.33] Yousif Zaid: She was knighted, so it was “Lady Ada Lovelace”
[14/09/2025, 10.44.16] Yousif Zaid: Anyhow did you still want to do something chill today or should I just let you rest?

[15/09/2025, 15.05.35] Yousif Zaid: But you should know that using the word “lend” with me will make me wanna tear my eyes out don’t do that
[15/09/2025, 15.05.39] Yousif Zaid: That’s dramatic I realise

[15/09/2025, 20.09.10] Yousif Zaid: You deleted this message.
[15/09/2025, 20.27.20] Yousif Zaid: Funny part is this is the only thing condoms are used for around here
[15/09/2025, 20.30.13] Ems : The deleted message is more mysterious than ever
[15/09/2025, 20.30.38] Ems : If you ever drink from the tap just think
[15/09/2025, 20.30.49] Yousif Zaid: It was literally just this message but worded more awkwardly
[15/09/2025, 20.31.01] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[15/09/2025, 20.48.12] Yousif Zaid: video omitted
[15/09/2025, 21.17.56] Ems : I have a full day of classes and then the dinner with all of them, if we finish early we could go for a walk but maybe lunch is better on my own to use up some stuff and run to the lecture if that's ok
[15/09/2025, 21.18.11] Ems : You must be so smug right now
[15/09/2025, 21.18.28] Ems : It was actually very ingenious
[15/09/2025, 21.19.11] Yousif Zaid: Of course it’s okay we’re busy people nobodies feelings are gonna get hurt
[15/09/2025, 21.20.00] Yousif Zaid: Claudio told me “I thought Emma would tell you about the dinner”. He’s convinced it’s happening at hempel, just let him know otherwise, we have enough space at my place
[15/09/2025, 21.20.55] Ems : I did tell you actually multiple times
[15/09/2025, 21.21.00] Yousif Zaid: Claudio believed in me so I have nobody to be smug at.

[15/09/2025, 21.23.16] Ems : No why
[15/09/2025, 21.23.43] Ems : It would've been fun but it's just sushi
[15/09/2025, 21.23.45] Yousif Zaid: I don’t like forgetting things people tell me
[15/09/2025, 21.24.10] Ems : Yuyu don't worry you're going to have fun with Laura honestly it worked out
[15/09/2025, 21.24.27] Ems : Also it's basically Claudio's fault cause I told him to tell everyone
[15/09/2025, 21.24.56] Yousif Zaid: Ah, What can do
[15/09/2025, 21.25.07] Yousif Zaid: How’d studying go?

[15/09/2025, 21.26.53] Ems : Wait you had to drive him in the end?

[15/09/2025, 22.00.29] Ems : It's a Tuesday ya know
[15/09/2025, 22.00.35] Yousif Zaid: Maybe a “glass of wine with dinner” kind of night but no more
[15/09/2025, 22.00.46] Yousif Zaid: Can you drink wine with sushi?

[15/09/2025, 22.07.26] Ems : No don't think that I didn't actually study the stuff
[15/09/2025, 22.07.35] Ems : I just took notes bc I'm tired
[15/09/2025, 22.08.06] Yousif Zaid: I’m just a bit anxious about the bio stuff honestly
[15/09/2025, 22.20.34] Ems : It's mostly group work in the end right?
[15/09/2025, 22.20.54] Ems : Also once I actually learn more about bio we can study it together
[15/09/2025, 22.21.21] Yousif Zaid: I appreciate the thought. I just can't make sense of the course
[15/09/2025, 22.21.31] Yousif Zaid: like with the rest its not like i've mastered it but I at least know somewhat what to do
[15/09/2025, 22.21.41] Yousif Zaid: but it just feels completely random every week with this stuff
[15/09/2025, 22.22.04] Ems : The course is probably really shit
[15/09/2025, 22.22.08] Yousif Zaid: it is
[15/09/2025, 22.22.36] Ems : Yeah I think the problem is that they're trying to teach too much and not enough basics
[15/09/2025, 22.23.04] Yousif Zaid: I don't know any basics at all. like they're using words like "Transcriptome"
[15/09/2025, 22.23.59] Yousif Zaid: no clue. itll take a lot of work
[15/09/2025, 22.26.24] Ems : You'll be fine I'm sure of it

[15/09/2025, 22.26.57] Yousif Zaid: i'm spending all my time "keeping up"
[15/09/2025, 22.27.03] Ems : The best thing for biology is YouTube videos otherwise everything is too abstract

She's out with her friends and will be home at 7, but plans on preparing us a fish we can just toss in the oven. my thinking is we can show up whenever (perhaps after lectures) , watch a little TV/a movie until she gets here, and i time it so that the fish is ready when she's home and we can all sit together and eat
[22/09/2025, 20.43.09] Ems : Sounds great

[22/09/2025, 21.41.25] Ems : Let's just keep saying great minds
[22/09/2025, 21.41.30] Yousif Zaid: Like how we chased Sofia and Dmitri thinking we were playing tag

[22/09/2025, 21.42.36] Yousif Zaid: You’re probably fine not rewriting it
[22/09/2025, 21.42.36] Ems : Ugh fine

[22/09/2025, 21.43.32] Yousif Zaid: Read it in mine and let me know
[22/09/2025, 21.43.36] Ems : I've heard it too many times from him
[22/09/2025, 21.44.26] Ems : There's no desire to punch a face in yours so it's good
[22/09/2025, 21.44.40] Yousif Zaid: I’ll try it in real life and we’ll see
[22/09/2025, 21.44.58] Yousif Zaid: Yk I thought about it and I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t think anyone would care if you hit me

[22/09/2025, 21.45.31] Yousif Zaid: Like I just don’t think anyone would care. Picture me complaining about it

[22/09/2025, 21.45.47] Yousif Zaid: How’s Soheyl reacting you think?
[22/09/2025, 21.46.52] Ems : Yeah that's really fair
[22/09/2025, 21.47.08] Ems : People would probably ask me what happened
[22/09/2025, 21.47.10] Ems : Like
[22/09/2025, 21.47.17] Yousif Zaid: “Oh did he deserve it”
[22/09/2025, 21.47.25] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
[22/09/2025, 21.47.32] Ems : Like what's my reasoning
[22/09/2025, 21.47.55] Ems : Probably goes the other way around too don't worry

[23/09/2025, 06.56.01] Yousif Zaid: Feels like a pinched nerve, not muscle soreness; breathing in sends pain down my arm
[23/09/2025, 07.21.12] Yousif Zaid: I took the hottest shower physically possible I mean I boiled myself and I feel better

[23/09/2025, 15.32.53] Ems : [23/09/2025, 15.33.12] Yousif Zaid: And I feel like cutting open a cake to take your third slice is fatass behavior
[23/09/2025, 15.33.34] Ems : Follow your heart yuyu
[23/09/2025, 15.33.38] Ems : Somebody's gotta do it
[23/09/2025, 15.33.40] Ems : But

[26/09/2025, 16.10.51] Yousif Zaid: I told Louis 19:30. Perhaps it’s best I pick you up at 19:00 and we leave then?
[26/09/2025, 16.10.56] Yousif Zaid: Look for parking and whatnot
[26/09/2025, 16.11.18] Yousif Zaid: No time for a hangout it seems

[26/09/2025, 16.14.18] Yousif Zaid: Is this shitty of me?
[26/09/2025, 16.20.17] Yousif Zaid: The more I think about it the more I realise I should just probably get over any feared awkwardness
[26/09/2025, 16.31.21] Ems : No it's fair enough but like
[26/09/2025, 16.31.33] Ems : It's not like we'd spoon on the couch

[27/09/2025, 10.32.27] Yousif Zaid: It’s one of the few things on earth where it’s just not worth it to home make it
[27/09/2025, 10.32.32] Yousif Zaid: I’ll bring you some to try, assuming I don’t eat the entire container [27/09/2025, 10.33.17] Ems : Fair

[27/09/2025, 16.44.08] Yousif Zaid: What’s going on at base camp btw?
[27/09/2025, 16.44.21] Yousif Zaid: Is that what Elena told us about last night? I don’t remember so good
[27/09/2025, 16.44.35] Ems : No

[27/09/2025, 16.45.50] Ems : I tend to do that
[27/09/2025, 16.46.50] Yousif Zaid: That’s sounds nice. Main reason I didn’t wanna go out to Reffen was cuz of the distance and time
[27/09/2025, 16.47.05] Yousif Zaid: You don’t wanna know what I do when I listen to them, you’re good trust me
[27/09/2025, 16.48.00] Ems : Mm
[27/09/2025, 16.48.15] Ems : Yeah it's so fucking far
[27/09/2025, 16.48.44] Yousif Zaid: I’m trimming the moustache hairs right now
[27/09/2025, 16.48.47] Yousif Zaid: Want me to save you some
[27/09/2025, 16.51.47] Ems : Yeah ofc
[27/09/2025, 16.52.15] Yousif Zaid: I’m sick in the head you know this I will actually keep one in my wallet
[27/09/2025, 16.52.49] Ems : I wouldn't expect anything else
[27/09/2025, 16.53.02] Yousif Zaid: My moms gone out again
[27/09/2025, 16.53.11] Yousif Zaid: She’s a social butterfly I think
[27/09/2025, 16.55.57] Ems : She has more friends than me
[27/09/2025, 16.56.07] Ems : Are you home alone again hahahahahahaha
[27/09/2025, 16.56.21] Yousif Zaid: I think so? This is humiliating
[27/09/2025, 16.56.33] Ems : ...
[27/09/2025, 16.56.45] Ems : Wow
[27/09/2025, 16.56.54] Ems : audio omitted

[27/09/2025, 16.58.16] Ems : Umh that sounds like a plan but you could also come to the basecamp thing?
[27/09/2025, 16.58.33] Ems : You know it
[27/09/2025, 16.58.37] Yousif Zaid: Am I even invited to that or is it kind of like a “anyone shows up” thing
[27/09/2025, 16.58.58] Ems : It's not someone's party
[27/09/2025, 16.59.11] Ems : audio omitted

[27/09/2025, 17.00.28] Yousif Zaid: Like I’m actually a bit upset you closed the door in his face so fast
[27/09/2025, 17.00.37] Yousif Zaid: Like I wanted to yell at him
[27/09/2025, 17.00.46] Yousif Zaid: Knocking on doors at 2 am is like “who raised you” behavior
[27/09/2025, 17.01.34] Yousif Zaid: I wouldn’t be bothered by only girls coming to base camp. If you want me there I think it would be fun [27/09/2025, 17.04.48] Ems : Yeah ofc
[27/09/2025, 17.05.22] Yousif Zaid: I’m not intruding on some girls night am I?
[27/09/2025, 17.05.47] Ems : Nah
[27/09/2025, 17.05.56] Ems : I told you drin might be coming
[27/09/2025, 17.06.12] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/09/2025, 17.06.27] Yousif Zaid: Fuck my hand looks like roast beef I need to moisturise
[27/09/2025, 17.06.51] Ems : You're probably better off she's very pretty
[27/09/2025, 17.06.58] Yousif Zaid: I ate her
[27/09/2025, 17.07.07] Yousif Zaid: Can you take me back
[27/09/2025, 17.07.27] Ems : Not after you killed your last woman
[27/09/2025, 17.07.54] Yousif Zaid: How did this work for Henry the 8th
[27/09/2025, 17.08.39] Ems : True but he was a piece of shit
[27/09/2025, 17.08.49] Ems : Ok fineee I'll take you back

[27/09/2025, 17.09.42] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[27/09/2025, 17.10.54] Ems : Little bitch was a tyrant
[27/09/2025, 17.11.05] Ems : Now imagine what the guy from last night would say
[27/09/2025, 17.11.13] Ems : "do you hear the music"
[27/09/2025, 17.11.27] Yousif Zaid: I gotta fight that guy
[27/09/2025, 17.11.32] Yousif Zaid: Knocked TWICE
[27/09/2025, 17.11.45] Yousif Zaid: I don’t know my history super well I should have figured
[27/09/2025, 17.27.39] Yousif Zaid: When and where btw? Do I pick you and Elena up?
[27/09/2025, 17.36.59] Ems : audio omitted
[27/09/2025, 17.41.07] Ems : audio omitted
[27/09/2025, 17.59.26] Yousif Zaid: I can’t really hear you so good I can’t lie
[27/09/2025, 18.00.18] Yousif Zaid: I think Elena is not coming
[27/09/2025, 18.00.26] Yousif Zaid: And something about 8

[28/09/2025, 01.06.40] Ems : Goodnight yuyu
[28/09/2025, 01.06.58] Yousif Zaid: Goodnight baby
[28/09/2025, 01.07.15] Yousif Zaid: image omitted

[28/09/2025, 10.00.45] Yousif Zaid: Good morning angel (I still might go back to bed), how’d you sleep
[28/09/2025, 10.30.44] Ems : Good morning yuyu
[28/09/2025, 10.30.57] Ems : I slept ok, I woke up at 7.30 ish
[28/09/2025, 10.30.59] Ems : You?
[28/09/2025, 11.34.17] Yousif Zaid: I just woke up again. I’m feeling pretty sleepy still but it gets to a point [28/09/2025, 11.37.51] Yousif Zaid: How come? Didn’t you sleep at 1?
[28/09/2025, 11.56.13] Ems : Did you just get 10 hours of sleep
[28/09/2025, 11.56.20] Ems : Yeah idk
[28/09/2025, 11.56.39] Yousif Zaid: Yes and I dreamt nice things the whole time
[28/09/2025, 11.56.47] Ems : Are you guys having brunch? Sorry I couldn't join btw but I didn't get any studying done yesterday
[28/09/2025, 11.56.53] Ems : Tell me
[28/09/2025, 11.57.19] Ems : audio omitted
[28/09/2025, 11.58.25] Yousif Zaid: Yes we’re gonna start having it now. It’s okay baby. The whole reason I said what I said last night before I left is cuz I don’t like hearing you come up with reasons or “excuses” when you’re too busy with something you don’t gotta justify yourself to me
[28/09/2025, 11.58.50] Yousif Zaid: We were walking through a field is all I remember now
[28/09/2025, 11.59.35] Yousif Zaid: Oh I had the complete opposite reaction to waking up at 10;30 I just said to myself it’s too early for this shit
[28/09/2025, 11.59.52] Ems : No but that's it. It's not me justifying myself I'm genuinely sorry I couldn't join
[28/09/2025, 12.00.04] Ems : I would've loved sunday brunch
[28/09/2025, 12.00.22] Ems : But yeah thank you for clearing that up I was kind of confused
[28/09/2025, 12.00.31] Ems : As we do
[28/09/2025, 12.19.28] Yousif Zaid: Maybe it’s just a linguistic thing for me then. To me “sorry” is for when you actually do something wrong or don’t follow up on an obligation, and I don’t like feeling like an obligation, but I guess it’s just not that deep is it
[28/09/2025, 12.19.40] Yousif Zaid: “Problem” solved I guess
[28/09/2025, 12.20.00] Yousif Zaid: It was real good this time too. Chunks of meat
[28/09/2025, 12.20.47] Yousif Zaid: You looked real nice
[28/09/2025, 12.23.25] Yousif Zaid: Dear god my brother is bringing all his construction worker friends over for dinner today and doesn’t even know how many of them there will be
[28/09/2025, 12.27.58] Ems : Don't tell me that
[28/09/2025, 12.28.13] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
[28/09/2025, 12.28.24] Ems : It's going to be so entertaining
[28/09/2025, 12.28.28] Yousif Zaid: My mom is stressing the fuck out making foccacia she don’t even know how much to make
[28/09/2025, 12.28.44] Yousif Zaid: Pulling meat out the freezer asking my dad “is it enough????” And he’s like “lol idk”
[28/09/2025, 12.28.51] Ems : Hahahahahshahhahah
[28/09/2025, 12.29.01] Ems : Gotta love ayman
[28/09/2025, 12.29.07] Ems : Your poor mom
[28/09/2025, 12.29.32] Ems : Over here they're going to make 200 gyozas

[29/09/2025, 13.19.33] Yousif Zaid: No you can’t
[29/09/2025, 13.19.39] Yousif Zaid: I’m just arguing for course equivalency
[29/09/2025, 13.19.55] Yousif Zaid: I understand the chin and knee bruise but I got no clue how Sofia could have possibly gotten that bicep bruised
[29/09/2025, 13.20.32] Ems : Yeah I thought so
[29/09/2025, 13.20.44] Ems : It's haunting me rn
[29/09/2025, 13.20.54] Yousif Zaid: Did he just beat the piss out of her ahhahahahahahhaha
[29/09/2025, 13.20.57] Ems : How do you get that bruise
[29/09/2025, 13.21.05] Ems : Somebody grabs your arm
[29/09/2025, 13.21.07] Ems : That's how
[29/09/2025, 13.21.18] Yousif Zaid: I couldn’t grab anyone’s arm that hard
[29/09/2025, 13.21.22] Yousif Zaid: That bruise is fucking massive
[29/09/2025, 13.21.44] Yousif Zaid: Guy who gets a girl drunk so he can practice martial arts on her
[29/09/2025, 13.21.50] Yousif Zaid: This is a new one
[29/09/2025, 13.22.10] Ems : It's so fucking suspicious
[29/09/2025, 13.22.21] Yousif Zaid: Like what the fuck are we doing here
[29/09/2025, 13.23.55] Yousif Zaid: The fact he’s not here today is even weirder
[29/09/2025, 13.24.28] Ems : There is one thing that's really weird to me
[29/09/2025, 13.24.33] Ems : Specifically
[29/09/2025, 13.24.37] Yousif Zaid: Tell me
[29/09/2025, 13.24.51] Yousif Zaid: Is it putting her to bed and then her waking up with him next to her
[29/09/2025, 13.24.52] Ems : The fact that she woke up on the bed next to him
[29/09/2025, 13.24.56] Ems : Yeah
[29/09/2025, 13.24.57] Ems : Like
[29/09/2025, 13.25.08] Ems : I think that's the most suspicious part
[29/09/2025, 13.25.17] Yousif Zaid: Idk man
[29/09/2025, 13.25.18] Ems : Wouldn't you just leave after putting her to bed
[29/09/2025, 13.25.24] Yousif Zaid: If it was me I’d have slept on the floor if anything
[29/09/2025, 13.25.27] Yousif Zaid: Bathtub?
[29/09/2025, 13.25.33] Yousif Zaid: I’ve slept in a bathtub before
[29/09/2025, 13.25.34] Ems : There's a couch
[29/09/2025, 13.25.44] Yousif Zaid: Is there a bathtub?
[29/09/2025, 13.25.44] Ems : A really big one
[29/09/2025, 13.25.58] Ems : I think shower? I can't remember
[29/09/2025, 13.26.05] Yousif Zaid: I went to Mathiass’s graduation party and I drank 11 mojitos and took an hour long nap in his basement bathtub
[29/09/2025, 13.26.17] Yousif Zaid: Woke up, walked out without saying goodbye to anyone and took the train home
[29/09/2025, 13.26.33] Yousif Zaid: It’s weirdddd
[29/09/2025, 13.26.40] Ems : So mysterious of you really
[29/09/2025, 13.26.53] Yousif Zaid: I was too drunk to speak
[29/09/2025, 13.26.59] Yousif Zaid: Didn’t want to embarrass myself
[29/09/2025, 13.27.02] Ems : Sipped on 11 mojitos like a 16 year old teenage white girl and disappeared
[29/09/2025, 13.27.12] Yousif Zaid: You know it
[29/09/2025, 13.27.18] Ems : Yeah
[29/09/2025, 13.27.20] Ems : Idk
[29/09/2025, 13.27.42] Yousif Zaid: It’s the first time I’ve heard of something like this but in high school it’d often be the case where it’s like
[29/09/2025, 13.28.14] Yousif Zaid: He volunteers really hard to help a drunk girl ya know
[29/09/2025, 13.28.35] Ems : In a nice way right?
[29/09/2025, 13.29.06] Yousif Zaid: I hope so, I never end up seeing what happens
[29/09/2025, 13.29.13] Yousif Zaid: I think so
[29/09/2025, 13.29.22] Yousif Zaid: Like “oh let me walk her to the station”
[29/09/2025, 13.29.28] Yousif Zaid: And they go off
[29/09/2025, 13.29.31] Ems : He actually did that to me
[29/09/2025, 13.29.37] Ems : He was really nice
[29/09/2025, 13.29.52] Yousif Zaid: No bruises?
[29/09/2025, 13.29.52] Ems : That one time at bootleggers
[29/09/2025, 13.29.56] Ems : None
[29/09/2025, 13.30.20] Yousif Zaid: Idk. Maybe invite a third friend if he shows up to hempel with tequila ahhahahah
[29/09/2025, 13.30.52] Ems : I mean I don't see a situation of me and soheyl drinking tequila alone
[29/09/2025, 13.31.04] Yousif Zaid: Another strange detail
[29/09/2025, 13.31.26] Ems : To be fair I almost went to the pres as well
[29/09/2025, 13.31.36] Ems : I was set to go until I decided for Basecamp
[29/09/2025, 13.31.44] Ems : But they had organised between them
[29/09/2025, 13.31.51] Yousif Zaid: I’m very glad you did, it was nice
[29/09/2025, 13.32.04] Ems : Honestly yeah
[29/09/2025, 13.32.08] Ems : And reffen is far
[29/09/2025, 13.32.24] Ems : Although I will propose to the group to go before October break
[29/09/2025, 13.32.32] Yousif Zaid: To Reffen?
[29/09/2025, 13.33.13] Yousif Zaid: Bicep bruise, man
[29/09/2025, 13.33.54] Ems : It's not mandatory to stop by Sofia's place yk
[29/09/2025, 13.34.10] Yousif Zaid: They never made it out the house
[29/09/2025, 13.34.14] Yousif Zaid: So strange
[29/09/2025, 13.34.16] Yousif Zaid: Does she live alone
[29/09/2025, 13.34.26] Ems : Yes
[29/09/2025, 13.34.38] Ems : It's really weird
[29/09/2025, 13.34.47] Ems : Wth
[29/09/2025, 13.35.54] Yousif Zaid: You gonna talk to her
[29/09/2025, 13.36.25] Ems : I want to but today she seemed very chill with the situation
[29/09/2025, 13.36.33] Ems : I'll talk to her alone maybe?
[29/09/2025, 13.36.41] Yousif Zaid: Probably the move?
[29/09/2025, 13.37.15] Yousif Zaid: Im not saying that he did do anything but putting yourself into this type of situation anyway is absolutely nuts to me
[29/09/2025, 13.37.38] Yousif Zaid: I bring you bottles of pink lemonade faxe kondi
[29/09/2025, 13.38.00] Ems : And coke zero
[29/09/2025, 13.38.31] Yousif Zaid: Like as a dude you are not supposed to get shitfaced 1 on 1 with women and spend the night people will look at you weird
[29/09/2025, 13.38.45] Ems : The thing is, they took a lot of shots so they must have known it was going to get bad
[29/09/2025, 13.38.49] Ems : The bottle was gone
[29/09/2025, 13.39.06] Yousif Zaid: I’m not saying it was accidental but like. ^^^
[29/09/2025, 13.39.31] Ems : Yup
[29/09/2025, 13.42.06] Ems : I will talk to her
[29/09/2025, 13.42.15] Ems : But I also want to talk to him
[29/09/2025, 13.42.30] Yousif Zaid: What do you want to say to him?
[29/09/2025, 13.43.27] Ems : Just hear his version
[29/09/2025, 13.43.36] Ems : Nothing really
[29/09/2025, 13.44.10] Ems : I don't think it's that deep, I want to hear about his perspective
[29/09/2025, 13.44.12] Yousif Zaid: I predict it will be “oh I don’t remember”
[29/09/2025, 13.44.18] Ems : For sure
[29/09/2025, 13.44.56] Yousif Zaid: I think just making sure Sofia is good makes sense and if she is then hearing Soheyl out will just be gossip, which is fine too
[29/09/2025, 13.52.02] Ems : No I truly don't want the gossip
[29/09/2025, 13.52.16] Ems : I want to make sure she's okay
[29/09/2025, 13.52.28] Ems : I thought it made sense since she said she doesn't know
[29/09/2025, 13.53.02] Yousif Zaid: We agree

[29/09/2025, 14.33.24] Ems : What is he even saying
[29/09/2025, 14.33.32] Ems : This can't be real
[29/09/2025, 14.33.34] Yousif Zaid: As in snakes can’t get on planes to travel to rich northern countries
[29/09/2025, 14.36.47] Ems : This is actually hilarious yuyu
[29/09/2025, 14.37.53] Yousif Zaid: Its very cute you find this so entertaining

[29/09/2025, 16.52.25] Yousif Zaid: I’m not sure yet
[29/09/2025, 16.52.35] Yousif Zaid: These things always come to me, as if in a vision
[29/09/2025, 16.53.28] Yousif Zaid: Visions that seem to disappear as you grasp at them, like bubbles blown by a child on a hot summer day
[29/09/2025, 16.54.38] Yousif Zaid: I just close my eyes and there’s food at the end
[29/09/2025, 16.59.50] Ems : How poetic
[29/09/2025, 16.59.55] Ems : Well let me know I'm curious
[29/09/2025, 17.00.12] Yousif Zaid: It may or may not involve a frozen 300 gram bag of chicken gyoza

[05/10/2025, 17.02.30] Yousif Zaid: There was a “Jimi Hendrix live in Copenhagen” cd that would have been the coolest fucking gift ever from a guy who lives in Copenhagen but it was obscenely expensive
[05/10/2025, 17.52.59] Ems : Perfect
[05/10/2025, 17.53.14] Ems : How expensive was it

[05/10/2025, 18.17.12] Yousif Zaid: It’s literally books I already have
[05/10/2025, 18.17.22] Yousif Zaid: Doesn’t cost me anything it’s like lending a book to a friend
[05/10/2025, 18.17.38] Yousif Zaid: As for the CD’s im just returning the favour

[05/10/2025, 18.19.14] Yousif Zaid: This is a pretty good summary I think
[05/10/2025, 18.24.42] Ems : He's going to absolutely adore it
[05/10/2025, 18.24.50] Ems : Very yuyu
[05/10/2025, 18.25.11] Yousif Zaid: The chet baker will make for very good ambient music
[05/10/2025, 18.25.50] Yousif Zaid: When I was actually in your house during the evenings I’d look around and think “this place is so cosy I can almost picture some Chet playing just in the background”
[05/10/2025, 18.26.14] Ems : I'm really glad you think that
[05/10/2025, 18.26.23] Ems : Definitely

[07/10/2025, 20.51.32] Yousif Zaid: yes!

[07/10/2025, 21.04.01] Yousif Zaid: yes. maybe we find a bookshop during our walk to the chicken shop

[07/10/2025, 21.08.52] Ems : Uuuu
[07/10/2025, 21.08.55] Ems : Nice
[07/10/2025, 21.09.13] Yousif Zaid: hm do i want to drive a pretty girl to her bus and then she kisses me on the cheek goodbye
[07/10/2025, 21.09.43] Yousif Zaid: actually i think a better use of my friday night is to go to a hipster bar with soheyl and pay 70 dkk an hour in the form of IPAs so i can get rage-baited
[07/10/2025, 21.10.16] Ems : Wait don't you have soheyl's dinner

[08/10/2025, 09.29.10] Ems : Impressive yuyu
[08/10/2025, 09.29.17] Ems : You must've been really tired
[08/10/2025, 09.29.38] Yousif Zaid: I’m getting dressed for our date because my linear ends right next to your apartment
[08/10/2025, 09.29.42] Yousif Zaid: I look muy guapo
[08/10/2025, 09.29.57] Ems : Qué bueno
[08/10/2025, 09.30.07] Ems : What time?
[08/10/2025, 09.30.50] Yousif Zaid: About the same time as your afternoon class ends
[08/10/2025, 09.31.13] Yousif Zaid: Exercises start at 15:00 but we never finish them so it’s like whatever I can leave when we like
[08/10/2025, 10.43.02] Ems : Okok
[08/10/2025, 13.51.24] Ems : How's the day going yuyu
[08/10/2025, 13.51.32] Yousif Zaid: Uhhhhh
[08/10/2025, 13.51.43] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[08/10/2025, 13.51.54] Yousif Zaid: We’re using a unit called dB/dec
[08/10/2025, 13.52.10] Yousif Zaid: And I tried asking the professor what a db is and what a decade is and he basically told me to kill myself
[08/10/2025, 13.52.22] Yousif Zaid: I’m just gonna have to assume that he means decibel per decade
[08/10/2025, 13.52.41] Yousif Zaid: This of course makes no sense but
[08/10/2025, 13.52.41] Ems : That's really helpful
[08/10/2025, 13.52.58] Ems : Ok I don't want to be a smartass
[08/10/2025, 13.53.00] Ems : But
[08/10/2025, 13.53.03] Ems : Why not ask chat
[08/10/2025, 13.53.24] Yousif Zaid: Wait
[08/10/2025, 13.53.59] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[08/10/2025, 13.54.53] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[08/10/2025, 13.56.40] Ems : Look at that
[08/10/2025, 13.56.48] Ems : Yours was a good guess
[08/10/2025, 14.01.20] Yousif Zaid: It’s apparently because decibel is a measurement of the gain that a sinusoidal wave experiences after being input into a transfer function
[08/10/2025, 14.01.42] Yousif Zaid: So we use decibels to measure noise because that’s just the amplitude of a sound wave, which also happens to be a sinusoid
[08/10/2025, 14.01.46] Yousif Zaid: This is so fucked up
[08/10/2025, 14.07.53] Ems : It's kind of cool though
[08/10/2025, 14.08.54] Yousif Zaid: It is
[08/10/2025, 14.08.57] Yousif Zaid: I don’t get it at all

[10/10/2025, 13.52.45] Ems : Maybe at like 5.45 so I can do the last things
[10/10/2025, 13.52.53] Ems : What did you say
[10/10/2025, 13.53.24] Yousif Zaid: “So I can be satisfied with the amount of time I’ve spent with you” is the actual meaning
[10/10/2025, 13.53.47] Yousif Zaid: The direct translation does actually sound like this if I think about it “so I’m full from you”
[10/10/2025, 13.55.43] Ems : I really like this
[10/10/2025, 13.56.03] Yousif Zaid: We use the word “full” for “satisfied with the amount I’ve had” in any context
[10/10/2025, 14.12.09] Ems : I like that in Arabic you speak so poetically
[10/10/2025, 14.12.16] Ems : Everything is a metaphor
[10/10/2025, 14.13.00] Yousif Zaid: One of my favourite phrases is to call somebody a garden
[10/10/2025, 14.13.15] Yousif Zaid: Like if they have nothing going on in their lives and they’re just generally useless and idle and don’t do anything
[10/10/2025, 14.13.23] Yousif Zaid: You call them a garden. Cuz gardens just sit there

[12/10/2025, 21.16.22] Ems : You must agree
[12/10/2025, 21.16.25] Ems : Like

[13/10/2025, 10.20.06] Ems : You probably don't remember this but
[13/10/2025, 10.20.11] Yousif Zaid: It probably backfired completely
[13/10/2025, 10.20.33] Ems : Last semester you talked to me about an entire plan about getting a girl to like you by giving her cigarettes
[13/10/2025, 10.20.43] Ems : I know everything I'm way ahead of you
[13/10/2025, 10.21.29] Yousif Zaid: Depending on when this happened it might have been about you
[13/10/2025, 10.22.10] Ems : No hahahahahahaha
[13/10/2025, 10.22.19] Ems : You talked to Marta about it
[13/10/2025, 10.22.22] Yousif Zaid: Cuz I definitely tried that on you
[13/10/2025, 10.22.27] Ems : At Claudio's birthday
[13/10/2025, 10.22.39] Ems : Yeah yeah
[13/10/2025, 10.23.03] Yousif Zaid: Ah that now I know what you’re talking about
[13/10/2025, 10.23.21] Ems : No it's just funny that Marta remembers it as well
[13/10/2025, 10.23.42] Yousif Zaid: Sorry Marta I tried it on your sister
[13/10/2025, 10.24.04] Yousif Zaid: (I’m talking to Marta “your sister” is you)
[13/10/2025, 10.24.20] Ems : Thanks for the clarification

[13/10/2025, 10.25.52] Yousif Zaid: I don’t have enough shit to do to justify a 40 hour work week
[13/10/2025, 10.26.16] Yousif Zaid: They’ll bitch check me. “Ah you worked 40 hours this week? What exactly did you get done”
[13/10/2025, 10.26.29] Ems : I wanted to say locked in but that sounds like alex
[13/10/2025, 10.26.48] Ems : Yeah you'll have to admit to sleeping in the basement
[13/10/2025, 10.26.58] Yousif Zaid: There’s some phrases you just don’t want your girlfriend to say [13/10/2025, 10.28.30] Yousif Zaid: “Tapped in”
“Locked in”
“Dap me up”
[13/10/2025, 10.30.11] Ems : You will never hear me say dap me up don't you worry
[13/10/2025, 10.30.19] Ems : I'd have to have a gun to my head
[13/10/2025, 10.30.33] Yousif Zaid: That’s why I like you ems
[13/10/2025, 10.30.59] Ems : As I said, the bar is on the floor
[13/10/2025, 10.31.36] Yousif Zaid: There’s a Seinfeld joke about how this is the case cuz 95% of the population is completely undate’able
[13/10/2025, 10.33.22] Ems : It's also in how I met your mother
[13/10/2025, 10.33.43] Yousif Zaid: Then Elaine asks Jerry “how do people hook up then?”
[13/10/2025, 10.33.48] Yousif Zaid: Jerry replies “alcohol”
[13/10/2025, 10.34.22] Ems : And the laughing track goes off
[13/10/2025, 10.34.29] Ems : That's good though
[13/10/2025, 10.34.35] Yousif Zaid: You fucking get it
[13/10/2025, 10.34.47] Ems : I get it
[13/10/2025, 10.35.14] Ems : Thank god I wear teeth masks because the chipped tooth is less noticeable
[13/10/2025, 10.35.25] Ems : Otherwise I look like a fucking degenerate
[13/10/2025, 10.35.32] Yousif Zaid: You look like
[13/10/2025, 10.35.39] Yousif Zaid: I say this in the nicest way possible
[13/10/2025, 10.36.02] Yousif Zaid: Farmhand girl next door
[13/10/2025, 10.36.15] Yousif Zaid: Like we live in the Midwest and grow corn

[13/10/2025, 12.37.18] Yousif Zaid: I am full
[13/10/2025, 12.37.53] Ems : Ok you're lying
[13/10/2025, 12.38.15] Yousif Zaid: I’m dead serious Greek yoghurt or like cement to me

[13/10/2025, 12.38.54] Yousif Zaid: It’s just Greek yoghurt
[13/10/2025, 12.39.38] Ems : You knew what I was going to say
[13/10/2025, 12.39.57] Ems : When it comes to greek yogurt you're a 90s supermodel
[13/10/2025, 12.40.05] Yousif Zaid: I am a big boy I just don’t know what it is with Greek yoghurt
[13/10/2025, 12.40.13] Yousif Zaid: Heroin chic
[13/10/2025, 12.42.59] Yousif Zaid: Kind of embarrassing the performances I was putting on at the breakfast table infront of Marta
[13/10/2025, 12.42.58] Ems : Literally
[13/10/2025, 12.47.53] Yousif Zaid: Btw how was the gym
[13/10/2025, 12.47.59] Yousif Zaid: Also do you have a copy of Emma I can borrow
[13/10/2025, 12.48.50] Ems : She fully judged you
[13/10/2025, 12.49.28] Ems : video omitted
[13/10/2025, 12.49.35] Yousif Zaid: Get me a little bit tipsy and put me in a sushi restaurant I can fully scare her
[13/10/2025, 12.49.44] Ems : Yes I think so I'll get home and check
[13/10/2025, 12.50.00] Ems : audio omitted

[13/10/2025, 16.33.24] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/10/2025, 16.59.16] Ems : Hahahahahahahahaah
[13/10/2025, 16.59.16] Ems : Right ok it's my fault
[13/10/2025, 16.59.26] Ems : How is it proceeding?
[13/10/2025, 16.59.34] Ems : Also I'll check if I have notes
[13/10/2025, 16.59.37] Ems : That might help
[13/10/2025, 16.59.52] Yousif Zaid: I’m the retard in question ems I was the one who wrote the notes
[13/10/2025, 17.00.10] Ems : I'll drink water
[13/10/2025, 17.00.20] Yousif Zaid: I would never call my baby a retard
[13/10/2025, 17.00.31] Yousif Zaid: I resist the urge and say drink water instead
[13/10/2025, 17.00.47] Yousif Zaid: God-awfully
[13/10/2025, 17.00.51] Ems : I think you maybe didn't take the lectures seriously enough
[13/10/2025, 17.00.58] Yousif Zaid: 100 pages of slides
[13/10/2025, 17.01.00] Ems : You do say that a lot
[13/10/2025, 17.01.03] Yousif Zaid: They need to be shot
[13/10/2025, 17.01.10] Yousif Zaid: This is what we’re doing to people now
[13/10/2025, 17.01.25] Ems : Yeah I was just about to ask
[13/10/2025, 17.01.28] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/10/2025, 17.01.38] Ems : Hold up let me look for notes
[13/10/2025, 17.02.02] Ems : I see PCR and I don't see how it relates I'll be honest
[13/10/2025, 17.02.14] Yousif Zaid: Amplifies dna somehow
[13/10/2025, 17.03.28] Yousif Zaid: audio omitted
[13/10/2025, 17.05.04] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/10/2025, 17.06.05] Ems : I know what pcr is
[13/10/2025, 17.06.13] Ems : It's the image I'm confused about
[13/10/2025, 17.06.19] Ems : dna.structure.docx • 4 pages document omitted
[13/10/2025, 17.06.47] Yousif Zaid: I wasn’t even reading out loud from the pcr part I thought this was just dna replication
[13/10/2025, 17.06.50] Ems : I don't know if this helps I'll be honest
[13/10/2025, 17.07.05] Yousif Zaid: I’m so confused
[13/10/2025, 17.07.11] Ems : PCR is basically that
[13/10/2025, 17.07.15] Yousif Zaid: I haven’t even gotten to the pcr part yet
[13/10/2025, 17.07.18] Yousif Zaid: Oh thank god
[13/10/2025, 17.07.22] Ems : Oh sorry for the spoiler
[13/10/2025, 17.07.36] Ems : audio omitted
[13/10/2025, 17.08.13] Yousif Zaid: Do whatever you want
[13/10/2025, 17.08.17] Yousif Zaid: Like I can hang it on my wall
[13/10/2025, 17.08.39] Ems : I realise for someone used to circuits this must sound like bullying
[13/10/2025, 17.09.14] Yousif Zaid: It sounds like schizophrenia in the same way it must sound like schizophrenia when I tell you about imaginary capacitance
[13/10/2025, 17.09.33] Yousif Zaid: And imaginary power
[13/10/2025, 17.09.40] Ems : Hey at least this isn't imaginary
[13/10/2025, 17.09.47] Ems : Less schizophrenic
[13/10/2025, 17.10.06] Yousif Zaid: Doesn’t feel so imaginary when I shock myself with it in real life
[13/10/2025, 17.11.21] Ems : I guess not
[13/10/2025, 17.11.34] Ems : Isn't that real current
[13/10/2025, 17.11.44] Ems : I know it's stupid but I don't know the difference
[13/10/2025, 17.11.47] Ems : Like
[13/10/2025, 17.11.57] Ems : I thought it was just for calculations
[13/10/2025, 17.12.21] Yousif Zaid: Look the only reason “i” is there is cuz alternating current is generated by a spinning motor
[13/10/2025, 17.12.36] Yousif Zaid: Spinning -> cosine and sine voltage/current
[13/10/2025, 17.12.57] Yousif Zaid: We get eulers and that’s why we have imaginary unit
[13/10/2025, 17.13.08] Ems : That makes so much sense
[13/10/2025, 17.13.11] Yousif Zaid: When i zap myself it’s very real
[13/10/2025, 17.13.31] Ems : I get it now
[13/10/2025, 17.13.46] Ems : Just don't lick them
[13/10/2025, 17.15.13] Yousif Zaid: It’s actually very cool stuff
[13/10/2025, 17.15.17] Yousif Zaid: I can’t help myself
[13/10/2025, 17.20.52] Ems : To be fair I zapped myself with a horse fence
[13/10/2025, 17.20.56] Ems : That was stupid
[13/10/2025, 17.46.36] Yousif Zaid: Not the stupidest thing to happen that day
[13/10/2025, 17.49.04] Yousif Zaid: Btw a church burned down in Italy?
[13/10/2025, 19.34.26] Ems : Really??
[13/10/2025, 19.34.48] Yousif Zaid: Idk my mom told me to ask you about it?
[13/10/2025, 19.35.31] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/10/2025, 19.35.32] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/10/2025, 19.35.58] Ems : In Lombardia
[13/10/2025, 19.36.31] Ems : I was following the news from Palestine so I didn't even hear
[13/10/2025, 19.36.57] Yousif Zaid: Did something new happen?
[13/10/2025, 19.37.02] Ems : It's a shame the paintings burned down
[13/10/2025, 19.37.20] Ems : Hamas released a lot of prisoners
[13/10/2025, 19.37.25] Ems : As part of the truce
[13/10/2025, 19.37.30] Yousif Zaid: All of them, no?
[13/10/2025, 19.37.40] Ems : I think so yes
[13/10/2025, 19.38.02] Yousif Zaid: Or what’s left of them, i guess. Carpet bombing the place wasn’t so good for the hostages health
[13/10/2025, 19.39.06] Yousif Zaid: How was your day baby?
[13/10/2025, 20.44.38] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[13/10/2025, 20.56.38] Ems : It was really nice, I just made shakshuka for the family
[13/10/2025, 20.56.50] Ems : I know it's a breakfast food but we have it for dinner
[13/10/2025, 20.56.54] Ems : WHAT
[13/10/2025, 20.56.58] Ems : Did you buy a vape
[13/10/2025, 20.57.02] Yousif Zaid: my mom has one
[13/10/2025, 20.57.06] Yousif Zaid: idk what she's smoking on honestly
[13/10/2025, 20.57.11] Yousif Zaid: i took a puff i needed to go lay down
[13/10/2025, 20.57.18] Ems : Your mom becomes cooler every day
[13/10/2025, 20.57.19] Yousif Zaid: shit knocked me on my ass
[13/10/2025, 20.57.35] Ems : Worse than Elena's?
[13/10/2025, 20.57.38] Yousif Zaid: worse.
[13/10/2025, 20.57.40] Ems : I think it's the same
[13/10/2025, 20.57.43] Ems : No way
[13/10/2025, 20.57.46] Ems : Ask her the percentage
[13/10/2025, 20.57.51] Yousif Zaid: maybe just cuz i haven't had any nic otherwise
[13/10/2025, 20.58.16] Yousif Zaid: btw i gotta ask are you a zionist or? just realised i never got ur take on that
[13/10/2025, 20.58.48] Ems : I swear we've talked about this
[13/10/2025, 20.58.52] Ems : Obviously not
[13/10/2025, 20.58.56] Yousif Zaid: alright
[13/10/2025, 20.59.00] Ems : I think so
[13/10/2025, 20.59.05] Ems : Why?
[13/10/2025, 20.59.29] Yousif Zaid: i dont wanna be weird or nothing i'm not a very political person generally but i hold the issue a bit close at heart being an arab and all
[13/10/2025, 20.59.55] Ems : No I get it
[13/10/2025, 20.59.58] Yousif Zaid: you'd really think so but like
[13/10/2025, 21.00.08] Yousif Zaid: i swear you'll find liberals with rainbow flags in their online usernames
[13/10/2025, 21.00.34] Yousif Zaid: for some reason they're also zionists, like its not one of those things where you can tell someones opinion on it
[13/10/2025, 21.00.59] Ems : True
[13/10/2025, 21.01.21] Ems : But usually it's because of some sort of tie to Israel
[13/10/2025, 21.01.23] Ems : Like family
[13/10/2025, 21.01.43] Yousif Zaid: like i've had to stop looking at the news cuz like. im seeing kids that look like my baby cousins just buried in rubble and stuff, it's disturbing
[13/10/2025, 21.02.40] Yousif Zaid: could be, i don't know.
[13/10/2025, 21.03.13] Ems : I do know what you mean, it's close to you
[13/10/2025, 21.03.28] Ems : Like victoria for example
[13/10/2025, 21.03.42] Yousif Zaid: all that to say, i'm very relieved, and we can go back to chatting about fun stuff like my moms blueberry watermelon ice vape
[13/10/2025, 21.04.01] Yousif Zaid: yeah idk its gotten to the point where i have a hard time being like "yeah we all have different opinions!" on this
[13/10/2025, 21.04.54] Ems : Mostly in the last year for me
[13/10/2025, 21.05.06] Ems : The news that came was very weird at first
[13/10/2025, 21.05.35] Ems : Like obviously you could tell they weren't telling the whole truth
[13/10/2025, 21.05.46] Yousif Zaid: "they just went crazy and started doing shit!"
[13/10/2025, 21.05.50] Yousif Zaid: "okay. why?"
[13/10/2025, 21.05.56] Yousif Zaid: "uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
[13/10/2025, 21.06.19] Yousif Zaid: its a whole can of worms
[13/10/2025, 21.06.48] Yousif Zaid: not to mention that israel funded hamas cuz they are fundamentalist religious conservatives so they could undermine the athiest palestinian liberation organisation back in the 80s
[13/10/2025, 21.08.09] Ems : I didn't know this
[13/10/2025, 21.09.44] Ems : Like this morning I woke up and we were just looking at the news for an hour
[13/10/2025, 21.09.53] Yousif Zaid: like i dont support hamas at all they'd prolly get mad at me for dating a white girl but ya know
[13/10/2025, 21.10.05] Yousif Zaid: this type of thing has happened before
[13/10/2025, 21.10.32] Yousif Zaid: fight the communists in afghanistan. leave all your weapons there and bam the taliban was created
[13/10/2025, 21.11.18] Yousif Zaid: many cases of "i don't like this group so i will create a worse group on accident or on purpose to fight the original group"
[13/10/2025, 21.12.15] Yousif Zaid: i really wish i could as well but i just can't bring myself to do it
[13/10/2025, 21.12.26] Yousif Zaid: i was a very political person when i was a teenager and it just made me miserable
[13/10/2025, 21.12.39] Ems : Yeah you're right it's a recurring thing in history
[13/10/2025, 21.13.16] Ems : I know what you mean

[13/10/2025, 21.37.47] Ems : She looks like she lives on the edge of Tevere

[13/10/2025, 21.41.27] Yousif Zaid: eyebrows are very necessary on all people
[13/10/2025, 21.42.13] Ems : The only women who could pull it off should have really small foreheads
[13/10/2025, 21.42.20] Ems : That's my theory
[13/10/2025, 21.42.26] Yousif Zaid: can any women pull it off?
[13/10/2025, 21.42.44] Yousif Zaid: mia goth comes to mind?

[13/10/2025, 21.43.10] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[13/10/2025, 21.43.22] Ems : No eyebrows fits the surname somehow
[13/10/2025, 21.43.25] Yousif Zaid: i mean she's barely got any eyebrows
[13/10/2025, 21.43.41] Yousif Zaid: i would say it would probably look nicer with more eyebrow though?
[13/10/2025, 21.43.54] Ems : Yeah maybe
[13/10/2025, 21.44.10] Yousif Zaid: i dont understand the micro bangs
[13/10/2025, 21.44.22] Yousif Zaid: i've heard them be called "man repellant". like on purpose when women dont want men to speak to them
[13/10/2025, 21.44.24] Ems : image omitted
[13/10/2025, 21.44.51] Yousif Zaid: yeah this is nicer no?

[13/10/2025, 21.45.36] Yousif Zaid: this looks like a haircut i'd give to my 1 year old daughter so i could giggle at her
[13/10/2025, 21.46.46] Ems : That's a 1300s monk and you can't convince me otherwise
[13/10/2025, 21.46.56] Yousif Zaid: is that abusive
[13/10/2025, 21.47.06] Yousif Zaid: its not abusive to make ur 1 year old look goofy for your own entertainment is it

[14/10/2025, 08.26.33] Yousif Zaid: How was the sunrise
[14/10/2025, 09.15.18] Ems : Absolutely beautiful, I didn't have my phone with me to take a picture, but it was really foggy on the ground, so it looked like the sunrise was floating
[14/10/2025, 09.15.43] Yousif Zaid: It’s probably very psychologically healthy to see the sunrise daily the way you do
[14/10/2025, 09.16.07] Ems : It is, I really love it
[14/10/2025, 09.16.11] Ems : I don't do it on purpose
[14/10/2025, 09.16.16] Ems : But it's a good benefit

[14/10/2025, 09.19.08] Yousif Zaid: I will also be waiting for you
[14/10/2025, 09.19.35] Yousif Zaid: I go to a lighthouse every night and yearnfully stare off into the sky waiting to see the plane
[14/10/2025, 09.20.14] Ems : That's really something to look forward to
[14/10/2025, 09.20.55] Yousif Zaid: I’m reading this in a sarcastic tone and that would make a really funny Seinfeld joke
[14/10/2025, 09.20.59] Yousif Zaid: Something Elaine would say

[14/10/2025, 09.21.49] Ems : But take it as you will
[14/10/2025, 09.21.55] Yousif Zaid: I know it would just make a funny bit
[14/10/2025, 09.22.09] Yousif Zaid: What’s the moves for today?
[14/10/2025, 09.22.27] Ems : I think I use sarcasm too much so that's automatically what you assume when you read my texts
[14/10/2025, 09.23.04] Ems : I'm washing the dogs soon, then I have to get some stuff from the store and I'm seeing a friend after lunch
[14/10/2025, 09.23.37] Yousif Zaid: That’s nice. Do you tell your friends about me?
[14/10/2025, 09.23.45] Yousif Zaid: I’m going to the office soon
[14/10/2025, 09.23.56] Ems : Yes
[14/10/2025, 09.24.16] Ems : I told my closest friends we got together
[14/10/2025, 09.24.24] Ems : But it's strange from a distance
[14/10/2025, 09.24.39] Yousif Zaid: How so?
[14/10/2025, 09.25.04] Ems : Like a video call isn't the same as seeing someone and talking
[14/10/2025, 09.25.26] Yousif Zaid: I wonder what questions girls ask each other when they hear their friend has started dating someone
[14/10/2025, 09.25.32] Ems : So I don't videocall my friends so often, I'd rather just see them and talk about everything
[14/10/2025, 09.25.37] Yousif Zaid: Guys don’t ask anything at all
[14/10/2025, 09.26.21] Yousif Zaid: I told the guys and they were like “yo congrats you actually did it” and then nothing
[14/10/2025, 09.27.00] Ems : It really depends on the person, some are like "tell me everything!!" ,Others are like "oh nice good for you"
[14/10/2025, 09.29.46] Yousif Zaid: I’m not gonna try and claim guys don’t gossip cuz they do a lot but somehow it’s never about their girlfriends. Like they don’t even ask how long you’ve been together
[14/10/2025, 09.30.17] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[14/10/2025, 09.31.11] Ems : I think that's mostly just your friends
[14/10/2025, 09.31.31] Ems : Like I don't know if you would gossip about me but some guys shit talk their girlfriends
[14/10/2025, 09.31.39] Ems : That's a really good plan
[14/10/2025, 09.31.43] Ems : Very full day wow
[14/10/2025, 09.31.58] Yousif Zaid: The closest I’ve ever gotten to shittalking you is checking the time on my phone next to Dmitri
[14/10/2025, 09.32.00] Ems : Until when are you staying at work?
[14/10/2025, 09.32.20] Yousif Zaid: And going “man her head is in the way”

[14/10/2025, 09.33.48] Ems : You'll never know if it's midnight or 8pm
[14/10/2025, 09.33.49] Yousif Zaid: Probably 5
[14/10/2025, 09.34.02] Yousif Zaid: I can look up at the moon
[14/10/2025, 09.34.08] Yousif Zaid: Having the forehead there is worth it
[14/10/2025, 09.34.24] Yousif Zaid: I been feeling a lil guilty abt this comment since go karting I had to tell you
[14/10/2025, 09.34.38] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[14/10/2025, 09.34.56] Ems : You just had to get it off your chest
[14/10/2025, 09.35.01] Yousif Zaid: In my defense it was really really funny Dmitri had to hit a crouch
[14/10/2025, 09.35.10] Ems : My big ass forehead is in the way HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[14/10/2025, 09.35.23] Yousif Zaid: Like when I imitated Claudio and said “but my voice must be heard!” When we checked his voting papers
[14/10/2025, 09.35.41] Yousif Zaid: And you had to hit a squat laughing
[14/10/2025, 09.35.48] Yousif Zaid: That’s always the best kind of laughs
[14/10/2025, 09.35.53] Ems : That was the funniest shit ever
[14/10/2025, 09.36.04] Ems : So true
[14/10/2025, 09.36.29] Yousif Zaid: “Honey please just tilt ur head a little”
[14/10/2025, 09.36.50] Yousif Zaid: No I set it to block the time on purpose your forehead is lovely and did no wrong
[14/10/2025, 09.53.07] Ems : It's so on the way

[14/10/2025, 09.54.31] Yousif Zaid: I feel like only one of the dogs really is a gremlin
[14/10/2025, 09.54.51] Ems : Ok I'm not going to ask which one
[14/10/2025, 09.54.58] Ems : Because she's my baby

[20/10/2025, 22.06.03] Yousif Zaid: someones gotta shoot me in the head man
[20/10/2025, 22.06.08] Ems : Obviously it was rethorical
[20/10/2025, 22.06.38] Ems : That's right your wife is there with you now and you're texting your mistress
[20/10/2025, 22.06.44] Ems : Damn
[20/10/2025, 22.06.52] Yousif Zaid: no i meant it in the deviant kind of way
[20/10/2025, 22.06.59] Ems : I know you did
[20/10/2025, 22.07.13] Yousif Zaid: its exhilarating
[20/10/2025, 22.07.24] Yousif Zaid: especially when your wife is a man and you are not gay
[20/10/2025, 22.07.43] Ems : I can imagine
[20/10/2025, 22.08.03] Yousif Zaid: how did i end up in this situation
[20/10/2025, 22.08.22] Ems : You really like your Italians apparently
[20/10/2025, 22.08.28] Yousif Zaid: fuuuuuuuckkkkkkk
[20/10/2025, 22.08.34] Ems : Yeah
[20/10/2025, 22.08.48] Yousif Zaid: i never wanted to end up one of those guys
[20/10/2025, 22.09.00] Yousif Zaid: like "oh i like girls from X country"
[20/10/2025, 22.09.23] Ems : Look at you now
[20/10/2025, 22.09.32] Ems : Wife and mistress from the same place
[20/10/2025, 22.09.39] Yousif Zaid: theres geographical conflict too
[20/10/2025, 22.09.44] Yousif Zaid: a terrone and a polentone
[20/10/2025, 22.10.17] Ems : First of all did you just call me terrone
[20/10/2025, 22.10.23] Yousif Zaid: yes
[20/10/2025, 22.10.25] Ems : Fuck you
[20/10/2025, 22.10.27] Yousif Zaid: wait how rude is that word
[20/10/2025, 22.10.43] Ems : Claudio really taught you some stuff huh
[20/10/2025, 22.10.54] Yousif Zaid: i have no idea how rude that word is
[20/10/2025, 22.11.10] Yousif Zaid: "Very much so, Terrone means “dirt worker/someone thst works in the dirt” and as such is seen as offensive. Unless you’re from the south I’d advise against saying it, same thing goes for dialect versions of it like Terun"
[20/10/2025, 22.11.14] Yousif Zaid: fuck really???
[20/10/2025, 22.12.01] Ems : Nono you go ahead
[20/10/2025, 22.12.03] Yousif Zaid: that's what he's been saying???
[20/10/2025, 22.12.11] Ems : Also I'm not from the south
[20/10/2025, 22.12.17] Ems : But whatever
[20/10/2025, 22.12.38] Ems : You'd usually say about people Naples and below
[20/10/2025, 22.12.46] Yousif Zaid: burino?
[20/10/2025, 22.12.59] Ems : Oh god
[20/10/2025, 22.13.11] Ems : That's just general
[20/10/2025, 22.13.21] Ems : You could say that about any region
[20/10/2025, 22.13.24] Ems : But like
[20/10/2025, 22.13.30] Ems : What has he been saying
[20/10/2025, 22.13.41] Yousif Zaid: he's thrown around the word terrone
[20/10/2025, 22.13.47] Yousif Zaid: i had to google burino
[20/10/2025, 22.13.53] Yousif Zaid: not about romans particularly
[20/10/2025, 22.14.01] Yousif Zaid: i was also told that some girls from a specific town have hairy armpits
[20/10/2025, 22.14.03] Yousif Zaid: and are communists
[20/10/2025, 22.14.05] Ems : Also nobody has ever said polentone I've never heard it in my life
[20/10/2025, 22.14.19] Yousif Zaid: fucking LOUIS told me to call claudio that
[20/10/2025, 22.14.20] Ems : God forbid armpit hair
[20/10/2025, 22.14.42] Ems : It's not insulting because it comes from the word polenta
[20/10/2025, 22.14.50] Yousif Zaid: polenta eater yes
[20/10/2025, 22.14.57] Yousif Zaid: louis calls claudio a terrone as well
[20/10/2025, 22.15.05] Ems : NICE
[20/10/2025, 22.15.08] Yousif Zaid: he calls him a person of color because "italians aren't white"
[20/10/2025, 22.15.11] Ems : I like louis
[20/10/2025, 22.15.28] Ems : I'll take it
[20/10/2025, 22.15.31] Yousif Zaid: so its kind of directed at you too but
[20/10/2025, 22.15.47] Yousif Zaid: there's always a bigger fish
[20/10/2025, 22.15.49] Yousif Zaid: someone more white
[20/10/2025, 22.15.59] Yousif Zaid: its fucked up how diverse the racist community is
[20/10/2025, 22.16.05] Yousif Zaid: they don't care who you are as long as you're being racist
[20/10/2025, 22.16.22] Yousif Zaid: its kind of sweet almost
[20/10/2025, 22.16.24] Ems : I can't compete with Louis's whiteness
[20/10/2025, 22.16.42] Ems : I'm slightly too tanned
[20/10/2025, 22.16.54] Yousif Zaid: also you see wild boars on the sidewalks in the morning
[20/10/2025, 22.17.00] Ems : Marginal
[20/10/2025, 22.17.07] Ems : Yuyu I'm going to sleep
[20/10/2025, 22.17.12] Ems : I'm tired

[20/10/2025, 22.18.55] Ems : [21/10/2025, 12.49.39] Ems : Sorry for running off, did you manage to finish the exercises?
[21/10/2025, 12.51.08] Yousif Zaid: Nope! They are tough for me
[21/10/2025, 12.51.13] Yousif Zaid: You have class soon?
[21/10/2025, 12.51.42] Yousif Zaid: No need to say sorry baby you had a call to make
[21/10/2025, 12.52.07] Yousif Zaid: Hope it’s nothing bad. In my head you scheduled a gossip session with Marta
[21/10/2025, 13.04.48] Ems : Yes I'm here right now
[21/10/2025, 13.05.12] Yousif Zaid: Shame, wanted to call you and chitchat for a bit. Not full from you
[21/10/2025, 13.05.32] Ems : Not a gossip session but nothing sad dw
[21/10/2025, 16.11.11] Yousif Zaid: Heyo. How’s class?
[21/10/2025, 16.33.56] Ems : Video call. 41 min
[21/10/2025, 20.02.45] Ems : Missed video call. Tap to call back
[21/10/2025, 20.02.48] Ems : Voice call. 1 min
[21/10/2025, 21.14.41] Yousif Zaid: Voice call. 1 min
[21/10/2025, 21.34.28] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[21/10/2025, 21.44.48] Ems : Maybe you could do it this way, I used kinetic energy= - work
[21/10/2025, 21.47.55] Yousif Zaid: Yeah that’s what I’m doing too but the work is an integral
[21/10/2025, 21.48.28] Ems : Ok I guess I used the potential energy instead
[21/10/2025, 21.48.33] Ems : So that it's not
[21/10/2025, 21.48.39] Yousif Zaid: Ah okay
[21/10/2025, 21.49.02] Ems : It's 0 at infinity I think so it's just the second case
[21/10/2025, 21.49.12] Ems : audio omitted
[21/10/2025, 22.02.24] Ems : I'm turning off my phone and reading yuyu

[21/10/2025, 22.20.27] Yousif Zaid: Turns out my method worked it’s just retarded
[21/10/2025, 23.09.51] Yousif Zaid: Alright I’m going to sleep now
[21/10/2025, 23.10.09] Yousif Zaid: The 20 minute cuddle was so nice
[22/10/2025, 09.36.12] Ems : Ok that wasn't so late in glad

[22/10/2025, 09.41.21] Ems : Morning yuyu
[22/10/2025, 10.58.02] Ems : audio omitted
[22/10/2025, 10.59.15] Yousif Zaid: I’m more than happy to do that but if you’re busy we don’t need to squeeze this in if it’ll stress you
[22/10/2025, 11.05.16] Ems : No it's ok I'll have to take a break at some point so we can just do that together, I just need to study afterwards
[22/10/2025, 11.05.42] Yousif Zaid: Let’s say after linear until dinner time?
[22/10/2025, 11.10.34] Ems : Sounds good
[22/10/2025, 11.10.57] Yousif Zaid: Tell me what to bring for dinner
[22/10/2025, 13.36.39] Ems : I have minced chicken in the freezer I can make something with that
Otherwise we can buy something else
[22/10/2025, 13.36.48] Ems : Any preference?
[22/10/2025, 13.37.33] Ems : We can always buy some chicken to roast and do it with potatoes I don't mind
[22/10/2025, 13.38.08] Yousif Zaid: Sounds like the thing to do
[22/10/2025, 13.38.19] Yousif Zaid: Nice roast chicken
[22/10/2025, 13.38.30] Yousif Zaid: Rosemary & potatoes?
[22/10/2025, 14.16.24] Ems : Yeah we can do some salad or roast a vegetable with it
[22/10/2025, 14.21.40] Yousif Zaid: Alright. I’ll bring chicken thighs. Do you have potatoes?
[22/10/2025, 14.25.13] Ems : We can just take a walk and get them together if you want
[22/10/2025, 14.25.18] Ems : And I do have potatoes
[22/10/2025, 14.31.11] Yousif Zaid: That sounds nice :)
[22/10/2025, 14.39.37] Yousif Zaid: Tell me when to show up at yours
[22/10/2025, 14.40.58] Ems : When do you finish?
[22/10/2025, 14.44.16] Yousif Zaid: Lecture ends in 15
[22/10/2025, 14.44.26] Yousif Zaid: Optional extra lecture til 16:00
[22/10/2025, 14.44.38] Yousif Zaid: And then we have exercises and the TA’s leave at 5
[22/10/2025, 14.44.47] Yousif Zaid: But we can never fucking finish the exercises anyway
[22/10/2025, 14.45.57] Yousif Zaid: I think I’ll stay for the extra lecture for dummies
[22/10/2025, 14.49.01] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[22/10/2025, 14.56.51] Ems : Ok I still have to do lots of exercises
[22/10/2025, 14.57.43] Ems : I'm confused do you want me to write the word down or what
[22/10/2025, 15.01.17] Yousif Zaid: It’s a phrase of speech
[22/10/2025, 15.01.40] Yousif Zaid: Like you see a homeless guy and you say “can you spell ‘crackhead’?”
[22/10/2025, 16.10.54] Yousif Zaid: Darling tell me when to leave the exercise place and come to hempel
[22/10/2025, 16.29.25] Ems : I just got home if you want to come over
[22/10/2025, 16.33.57] Yousif Zaid: On my way!!

[22/10/2025, 22.02.46] Ems : Hahahahahahahhaha

[23/10/2025, 09.14.46] Yousif Zaid: You have similar eyes to young Peggy I guess
[23/10/2025, 11.41.21] Ems : How's work going?
[23/10/2025, 11.41.39] Yousif Zaid: It’s nice
[23/10/2025, 11.41.51] Yousif Zaid: I’m at building 340 right now for lunch because it’s dtu electro project day
[23/10/2025, 11.42.03] Yousif Zaid: Free pizza
[23/10/2025, 11.42.15] Yousif Zaid: After that I go work on our robot
[23/10/2025, 11.42.25] Yousif Zaid: We had our solid phase extraction module delivered
[23/10/2025, 11.42.41] Yousif Zaid: So now we can get the robot to put the samples in there
[23/10/2025, 11.43.00] Ems : Oh yeah i just heard about that
[23/10/2025, 11.43.08] Ems : Uuu so cool
[23/10/2025, 12.15.21] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[23/10/2025, 12.54.37] Ems : Hahahahahahaha
[23/10/2025, 12.54.48] Ems : Kebab pizza Is so good
[23/10/2025, 12.54.59] Yousif Zaid: I did not even feel a little bad
[23/10/2025, 12.55.04] Yousif Zaid: I just left the project day
[23/10/2025, 12.55.14] Yousif Zaid: I swear to you the people at electro are doing science fiction shit
[23/10/2025, 12.56.23] Yousif Zaid: They’ve somehow figured out how to make circuits out of light and are able to train neural networks that are so fast that the limiting factor is the speed of light [23/10/2025, 12.56.39] Yousif Zaid: They call it “neuromorphic computing”
[23/10/2025, 14.40.12] Ems : Oh that's cool
[23/10/2025, 14.40.20] Ems : And you got free pizza on top of it
[23/10/2025, 14.40.31] Ems : This is super interesting really
[23/10/2025, 14.42.26] Yousif Zaid: It’s something you would hear about in Star Wars or something as a kid
[23/10/2025, 14.42.29] Yousif Zaid: What are you up to baby?
[23/10/2025, 15.03.05] Ems : image omitted
[23/10/2025, 15.03.05] Ems : image omitted
[23/10/2025, 16.10.33] Yousif Zaid: Grrr
[23/10/2025, 16.10.36] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[23/10/2025, 16.10.42] Yousif Zaid: I’m also in tha lab
[23/10/2025, 16.17.25] Yousif Zaid: Awful first thought
[23/10/2025, 16.38.17] Ems : Is it doing its thing??
[23/10/2025, 16.38.32] Yousif Zaid: Yes ma’am !
[23/10/2025, 16.38.34] Ems : Let's hear it
[23/10/2025, 16.38.40] Yousif Zaid: We need to set up solid phase extraction
[23/10/2025, 16.38.48] Ems : Happy for you
[23/10/2025, 16.39.00] Yousif Zaid: But weighing and ethanol pouring had an error rate of 1/(96*2)
[23/10/2025, 16.39.08] Yousif Zaid: Which is super fucking frustrating but workable
[23/10/2025, 16.39.14] Yousif Zaid: Ok
[23/10/2025, 16.39.51] Yousif Zaid: Dr leone can I get a physical inspection
[23/10/2025, 16.39.56] Yousif Zaid: Grr
[23/10/2025, 16.44.49] Ems : It's good news though
[23/10/2025, 16.44.53] Ems : HAHAHAHAHHAHAJA
[23/10/2025, 16.45.11] Yousif Zaid: Yeah but like. If the problem was obvious it would be reproducible right
[23/10/2025, 16.45.25] Yousif Zaid: It’s just frustrating that it goes wrong once per plate seemingly randomly
[23/10/2025, 16.45.43] Yousif Zaid: Like how do you fix the problem if you have no idea what the problem is
[23/10/2025, 17.05.24] Ems : Yeah it's weird idk
[23/10/2025, 17.05.36] Ems : Let me know if you do figure it out
[23/10/2025, 17.05.53] Yousif Zaid: I also need to see if it’s pouring the right amount of ethanol down
[23/10/2025, 17.06.17] Yousif Zaid: We weighed before and after and I’m gonna do some molar mass calculations and propagate out the error. I’m hoping it’s accurate within 5 microliters
[23/10/2025, 17.06.34] Yousif Zaid: Are you done in the lab?
[23/10/2025, 17.11.29] Ems : I'll pray
[23/10/2025, 17.11.31] Ems : Yes
[23/10/2025, 17.11.42] Ems : You?
[23/10/2025, 17.11.45] Yousif Zaid: How was it?
[23/10/2025, 17.11.59] Yousif Zaid: Yes I’m at home now engaging in a game of chicken with this numerical assignment
[23/10/2025, 17.13.37] Ems : Actually quite fun I had a good time
[23/10/2025, 17.13.47] Ems : I'm going to do some genetics notes
[23/10/2025, 17.13.58] Yousif Zaid: The longer I wait to do it

[01/11/2025, 20.39.32] Yousif Zaid: thats because list(1) actually gives you the first item in the list
[01/11/2025, 20.39.44] Yousif Zaid: in python (which we are used to), it would be list[0] to get the first item
[01/11/2025, 20.40.50] Ems : It's stupid that they would do that
[01/11/2025, 20.40.59] Ems : audio omitted

[01/11/2025, 20.43.11] Yousif Zaid: It’s based on some nerdy thing called pointer arithmetic
[01/11/2025, 20.44.23] Yousif Zaid: Ah. Whatever
[01/11/2025, 20.44.27] Yousif Zaid: Tell me something nice

[01/11/2025, 21.22.34] Yousif Zaid: I was like “not even in 2004? When I was born?” He was like “no”
[01/11/2025, 21.25.48] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAH
[01/11/2025, 21.26.08] Ems : Wait would you rather not be circumcised?

[01/11/2025, 21.29.53] Yousif Zaid: being told that it was basically done for the vibes makes it hilarious
[01/11/2025, 21.30.20] Yousif Zaid: here comes a 15 year old boy question: do you prefer it that way
[01/11/2025, 21.30.49] Ems : Literally just for the vibes

[02/11/2025, 16.39.47] Yousif Zaid: he has to not be racist when she's nearby

[03/11/2025, 13.12.37] Yousif Zaid: I might get Claudio to run it for me
[03/11/2025, 13.12.43] Yousif Zaid: He has a beefy computer
[03/11/2025, 13.12.54] Ems : Fair enough, I feel like it always helps to clear the mins
[03/11/2025, 13.12.57] Ems : D
[03/11/2025, 13.13.04] Yousif Zaid: Yes
[03/11/2025, 13.13.14] Yousif Zaid: The graveyard near ur apt is nice this time of year
[03/11/2025, 13.36.03] Ems : I know the whole area is
[03/11/2025, 13.36.07] Ems : I really like it
[03/11/2025, 13.36.32] Yousif Zaid: What’s the gym routine today?
[03/11/2025, 13.36.32] Ems : Is bio getting better with time?
[03/11/2025, 13.36.48] Yousif Zaid: Yes since I’ve decided to just code during the lectures
[03/11/2025, 13.54.56] Ems : Nice
[03/11/2025, 13.54.56] Ems : Legs
[03/11/2025, 13.58.04] Yousif Zaid: I scaled down the model to about 154 thousand params and it's kind of training now. itll take 5 minutes on my laptop I think. terrible shakespeare incoming:
[03/11/2025, 13.58.10] Yousif Zaid: ooh
[03/11/2025, 14.01.03] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/11/2025, 14.01.05] Yousif Zaid: This is shocking
[03/11/2025, 14.25.31] Ems : It reads how I think Algerian or Moroccan sounds
[03/11/2025, 14.30.29] Yousif Zaid: so arabic?
[03/11/2025, 14.30.32] Yousif Zaid: they do have a weird dialect
[03/11/2025, 14.30.38] Yousif Zaid: there's some english words in there!
[03/11/2025, 14.32.06] Ems : I don't know why but those countries came to mind
[03/11/2025, 14.32.17] Ems : It does
[03/11/2025, 14.32.17] Yousif Zaid: "I Father"
[03/11/2025, 14.32.24] Ems : He here
[03/11/2025, 14.32.26] Yousif Zaid: what impresses me is that it learned how plays are structured
[03/11/2025, 14.32.30] Yousif Zaid: like theres a
[03/11/2025, 14.32.36] Yousif Zaid: EMMA:
*line*
[03/11/2025, 14.32.42] Yousif Zaid: YOUSIF:
*Response*
[03/11/2025, 14.32.43] Yousif Zaid: going on
[03/11/2025, 14.33.00] Ems : It is quite good it's impressive
[03/11/2025, 14.33.02] Yousif Zaid: but this is a tiny 160k param toy that i made because it's the only thing i can train
[03/11/2025, 14.33.14] Yousif Zaid: The actual 10 mil param one that i'll do on claudios GPU should be noticably better
[03/11/2025, 14.36.10] Ems : I do think so
[03/11/2025, 14.36.12] Yousif Zaid: I'll let you know, we'll start training on that later today
[03/11/2025, 14.36.15] Ems : It will be much much better
[03/11/2025, 14.36.22] Yousif Zaid: manifesting
[03/11/2025, 14.36.24] Yousif Zaid: i like it
[03/11/2025, 14.36.25] Ems : image omitted
[03/11/2025, 14.36.28] Yousif Zaid: how's leg day going
[03/11/2025, 14.43.49] Yousif Zaid: beautiful
[03/11/2025, 14.46.33] Yousif Zaid: our bio prof has a thick italian accent
[03/11/2025, 14.54.25] Ems : It's goin good
[03/11/2025, 14.54.36] Ems : Now thank the lord I have English family
[03/11/2025, 14.54.47] Ems : I'm imagining bio talk with an Italian accent
[03/11/2025, 14.54.49] Yousif Zaid: its a whole thing
[03/11/2025, 14.54.58] Yousif Zaid: he's saying things i've never heard in my life
[03/11/2025, 14.55.02] Yousif Zaid: hold on i have something pretty sweet to show you
[03/11/2025, 14.55.28] Yousif Zaid: I trained the 1M transformer and it's actual english now (almost), and I can feed it input text to start off with [03/11/2025, 14.56.54] Ems : Let me see it
[03/11/2025, 14.56.58] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/11/2025, 14.57.13] Ems : Yuyu this is great
[03/11/2025, 14.57.26] Ems : I feel like I should be able to read this
[03/11/2025, 14.57.28] Yousif Zaid: I was hoping it would create some dialogue between a knight yousif and a princess emma
[03/11/2025, 14.57.33] Ems : Which means that it works
[03/11/2025, 14.57.45] Yousif Zaid: but it kind of just read my imput text and started babbling nonsense on top of it
[03/11/2025, 14.57.49] Ems : That would've been so cool
[03/11/2025, 14.57.56] Ems : Still feels like english
[03/11/2025, 14.57.59] Ems : So
[03/11/2025, 14.58.13] Yousif Zaid: maybe i should start feeding it sonnets
[03/11/2025, 14.58.20] Yousif Zaid: and just send you an awful love poem every 5 minutes
[03/11/2025, 14.58.54] Ems : I'm not sure it counts as a love poem if code creates it
[03/11/2025, 14.59.09] Yousif Zaid: but i made the code. from scratch
[03/11/2025, 14.59.16] Ems : Bitch
[03/11/2025, 14.59.19] Ems : It doesn't count
[03/11/2025, 14.59.37] Ems : It's like
[03/11/2025, 14.59.44] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/11/2025, 14.59.57] Ems : If my son writes a love poem it's not the same as me writing it right?
[03/11/2025, 15.00.13] Ems : HAHAHAHAJAJAJHAAH
[03/11/2025, 15.00.15] Ems : So cool
[03/11/2025, 15.00.21] Ems : HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
[03/11/2025, 15.00.29] Yousif Zaid: no i guess not
[03/11/2025, 15.00.47] Yousif Zaid: but we can agree that raising a son exclusively to write love poems is more effort than actually sitting down and writing one
[03/11/2025, 15.02.50] Ems : Depending on perspective so is learning to code to create love poems
[03/11/2025, 15.03.02] Yousif Zaid: image omitted
[03/11/2025, 15.03.26] Yousif Zaid: queen margaret and claudio are in this one
[03/11/2025, 15.03.32] Ems : I'm talking bullshit but I kind of get what I'm saying
[03/11/2025, 15.03.36] Ems : You know?
[03/11/2025, 15.03.51] Yousif Zaid: your boyfriend made his laptop perform about 100,000,000 matrix multiplications
[03/11/2025, 15.04.09] Yousif Zaid: so it could make you a princess in a made-up shakespeare play
[03/11/2025, 15.04.42] Ems : Oh ok that was the final aim
[03/11/2025, 15.04.46] Ems : Mmh
[03/11/2025, 15.04.51] Yousif Zaid: yes!
[03/11/2025, 15.04.58] Ems : Of course!!
[03/11/2025, 15.05.06] Yousif Zaid: actually if i augment the training data to make it actually train on stories of princess emma
[03/11/2025, 15.05.09] Yousif Zaid: now we have an idea
[03/11/2025, 15.05.13] Yousif Zaid: I could actually do that
[03/11/2025, 15.05.56] Yousif Zaid: it's like if we got you really really drunk & handed you the collected works of shakespeare and asked you to read out loud
[03/11/2025, 15.10.06] Yousif Zaid: I've decided I'm actually going to do that. I need to generate a lot of synthetic data from other models though, because I don't have time to write 300 thousand words on me saving you from dragons
[03/11/2025, 15.11.06] Ems : Give me 6 gin tonics and shakespeare and this is what happens
[03/11/2025, 15.11.11] Ems : Uuuu
[03/11/2025, 15.11.18] Ems : It going to be really cool
[03/11/2025, 15.11.30] Ems : If I'm just a damsel in distress I'm going to be a bit sad
[03/11/2025, 15.11.43] Yousif Zaid: tell me what kind of character you want to be
[03/11/2025, 15.11.54] Yousif Zaid: if i'm generating synthetic data we can make it whatever we want
[03/11/2025, 15.14.29] Yousif Zaid: Princess Emma of Rome? you can be from wherever you want.
[03/11/2025, 15.15.24] Yousif Zaid: maybe i can feed it our entire whatsapp chat history to get a feel for your personality
[03/11/2025, 15.15.28] Yousif Zaid: somehow
[03/11/2025, 15.18.46] Ems : No that's up to you
[03/11/2025, 15.18.51] Ems : This is so cool
[03/11/2025, 15.19.00] Ems : Doesn't that take a lot of work?
[03/11/2025, 15.19.21] Yousif Zaid: If i can figure out a way to get it out as a text file then its as simple as just pasting it into the "input.txt" that i'm feeding the transformer
[03/11/2025, 15.19.38] Yousif Zaid: okay well i'm obviously not gonna make you a 1 sided damsel in distress
